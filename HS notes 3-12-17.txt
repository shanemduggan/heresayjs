3/11: show people / get feedback
3/18: db & server research (online db or json file pref)
	* firebase, couchdb, aws, heroku











2. standardize names for data attributes
1. optimize crawlers
	- discover (need addresses)
	-laweekly (get 5 days out)
	- timeout (get full list of events)







laweekly parent crawl (4:51 - 8:30)
	* pulled roughly 4500 events (150 per day)
	* json can handle min 3900 events
	* if cap at 100 per day, max 3100 events
		- took ~45 min for 26 requests
	* error (FATAL ERROR: CALL_AND_RETRY_LAST 
			   Allocation failed - process out of memory)

discover parent crawl (~20 min)
	* pulled 1300 events, full month 2000
