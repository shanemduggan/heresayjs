Laced with musical sequences and cinematic style, ELEVATOR is a comedic and emotional ride into the human psyche and asks the fundamental question: who are you behind closed doors?","locationName":"Coast Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/elevator-8","date":"April 9","address":"8325 Santa Monica Blvd.  CA 90069","type":"Arts & Theater"},{"name":"Los Angeles Lakers v Minnesota Timberwolves","summary":"Los Angeles Lakers v Minnesota Timberwolves","locationName":"STAPLES Center","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/los-angeles-lakers-v-minnesota-timberwolves","date":"April 9","address":"1111 S.

Hardly a purist, Wilder has described the music he makes as, \"rock for roots fans and roots for rock fans.\" His 10 albums have solidified his reputation as one of roots rock's truest voices. His engaging personality led him to become one of America's first Satellite DJs on XM Radio.

Set to the searing highs and lows of Kanye West’s gospel-inspired hip-hop track, “Ultralight Beam,” Love Is The Message is a masterful convergence of found footage that traces African-American identity through a vast spectrum of contemporary imagery. From photographs of civil rights leaders watermarked with “Getty Images” to helicopter views of the LA Riots to a wave of bodies dancing to “The Dougie,” the meticulously edited 7-minute video suspends viewers in a swelling, emotional montage that is a testament to Jafa’s profound ability to mine, scrutinize, and reclaim media’s representational modes and strategies. Alongside segments of familiar Black icons and historic events are also scenes featuring lesser known figures: anonymous bodies in various states of elation and despair. Excerpts from Jafa’s own stunning documentary film, Dreams are Colder than Death (2012) inflects a personal dimension to imagery mostly drawn from news media, television and the Internet. In this pointed inclusion, Jafa discloses both his vulnerability and authority as an artist—what it means to contribute to the vast and complex terrain of Black representation. While Love Is The Message poignantly embodies the artist’s desire to create a cinema that “replicates the power, beauty and alienation of Black Music,” it is also a reminder that the collective multitude defining Blackness is comprised of singular individuals, manifold identities and their unaccountable differences.","locationName":"MOCA","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/arthur-jafa-love-message-message-death","date":"April 10","address":"250 South Grand Avenue Los Angeles CA 90012","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Hanging with Harris: David Lentz at The Hungry Cat","summary":"Celebrated culinary MC and fundraising auctioneer Billy Harris announces his new dinner series Hanging with Harris, a lineup of eight intimate, multi-course dining events taking place throughout Los Angeles this February through May.

Marshall’s figurative paintings have been joyful in their consistent portrayal of African Americans. The now nearly 600 year history of painting contains remarkably few African American painters and even fewer representations of black people. Marshall, a child of the civil rights era, set out to redress this absence. “You can’t be born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1955 and grow up in South Central [Los Angeles] near the Black Panthers headquarters,” Marshall has said, “and not feel like you’ve got some kind of social responsibility. You can’t move to Watts in 1963 and not speak about it.

In 2022, American Jews face an increasingly unsafe and anti-Semitic landscape at home. Against this backdrop, the Jacobson family gathers for Passover in Los Angeles. But their immediate problems are more personal than political, with the three adult children, Mo, Edith, and Jacob, in various states of crisis, the result, each claims, of a lifetime of mistreatment by their father, Julian. The siblings have begun to suspect that Julian is hastening their mother Roz's demise, and years of resentment boil over as they debate whether to go through with the real reason for their reunion: an ill-considered plot to end their father's iron rule for good. That is, if they can put their bickering, grudges, festering relationships, and distrust of one another aside long enough to act. And God help them if their mother finds out . . .   Tell Me How This Ends Well presents a blistering and prescient vision of the near future, turning the exploits of one very funny, very troubled family into a rare and compelling exploration of the state of America, and what it could become.","locationName":"","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/tell-me-how-ends-well","date":"April 12","type":"Arts & Theatre"},{"name":"My British Invasion","summary":"Harold Bronson discusses and signs My British Invasion.

Prophet explains, \"One day we were sitting in my so-called office South of Market listening to LPs, when out of frustration I picked up a guitar and shouted, 'I hear that record crackle, the needle skips and jumps!' and klipschutz shot back, 'Bobby Fuller died for your sins!'\" Who is Bobby Fuller? He's the star of the ultimate Rock and Roll Babylon feel-bad story. Prophet realizes that the title track makes a heavy claim, and laughs at the suggestion that it might shine new light on the mystery long surrounding Fuller's early demise. Fuller, who migrated from El Paso to L.A. in the early 1960s, has been described as \"a greaser in a world of Beach Boy bangs and Beatle boots, hopelessly out of step with the times.\" Found dead in his car at the age of 23, to a devoted coterie of fans, old and new, he'll always remain the skinny guy singing \"I Fought the Law\" on countless teen dance TV shows and radio playlists. Ruled a suicide, his death has haunted investigators since 1966. \"Some resolution would be nice,\" Prophet says, \"but I run a band, not a Cold Case squad.\" In conjunction with the release of his latest album, the GRAMMY Museum welcomes San Francisco-based singer/songwriter, guitarist and producer, Chuck Prophet, to the Clive Davis Theatre for an intimate conversation on his new music, followed by a special performance. The evening will be hosted by Scott Goldman, Vice President of the GRAMMY Foundation and MusiCares.","locationName":"GRAMMY Museum","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/drop-chuck-prophet","date":"April 13","address":"A245, 800 West Olympic Boulevard Los Angeles CA","type":"Museums & Galleries"},{"name":"Discovering Kosher/Soul","summary":"Michael W.

Free/all-ages show. Their new album, Gravedigging, is out March 31st on Innovative Leisure. Meet them and get the Gravedigging CD or LP signed by the band after the show. Playing live at The Wayfarer (Costa Mesa) 3/31 and The Observatory (Santa Ana) 4/8.\"It’s rare that a band can cohesively integrate dreamy '50s and '60s rock into the standard garage rock structure with finesse.\" - The BaitshopThe Buttertones’ Gravedigging is more a movie waiting to happen than an album—or a soundtrack just waiting to inspire a movie, with scene after scene of action, tension and release set to a sound that takes everything good and true about American music before the Beatles prettied it up (surf, sweet soul, the boss saxophone-overdrive garage of the Northwest wailers like the Sonics) and matches it to punk energy, post-punk precision and the kind of personality that blows the circuit-breakers at a backyard party. (Which actually happened, of course.) They’ve even got casting suggestions if anyone wants to start filming—like Willem DeFoe, Winona Ryder, Lucy Liu, and Tommy Wiseau in as many roles as possible. Says guitarist Dakota Boettcher: “We all love movies so much. When you listen to a soundtrack, it has peaks and it has lows, but it’s a whole journey. That’s what we want to do. We want you to go on a journey.”The Buttertones started their own journey in 2011 as three music school misfits (or drinking buddies, they say) in the heart of Hollywood, happy to learn how to to play, produce and perform but less excited about frequent go-nowhere conversations with classmates who had little interest in either the past or the future of music. So that’s why bassist Sean Redman (also a former member of Cherry Glazerr) felt like he’d lucked out when he found guitarist/singer Richard Araiza and drummer/polyinstrumentalist Modesto ‘Cobi’ Cobiån: “Cobi and Richard were the first guys I met where I thought they knew what they were talking about,” he says. “They had good influences—they weren’t just trying to pander.”Their first rehearsals were in a Hollywood bedroom where Redman was living on an air mattress, then Araiza finally locked down Boettcher—who he’d often see responding to the same casting calls as he did—to replace another guitarist who was transitioning back to family life even as the Buttertones prepared their debut release, a self-titled cassette on L.A.’s garage-pop Lolipop label. Then they absorbed sax player London Guzmån (formerly in Long Beach’s Wild Pack of Canaries with breakout local Rudy De Anda) after spotting him at a local DJ night, recruiting him for their sophomore album American Brunch—and discovering the kind chemistry they didn't know they were missing. Says Araiza: “We’re proud to be a legit band. It’s a very collaborative process—we rely on each other. I feel that’s rare nowadays, especially with rock bands.”When it came time to make Gravedigging—the follow-up to a special issue 8” for Innovative, which ended up pulling them aboard the label full-time—they knew it was time to go deeper and get dirtier. Recorded at Jazzcats studio in Long Beach—home-away-from-home to fellow Innovative Leisure artists Hanni El Khatib, Tijuana Panthers, Wall of Death and more—in the spring of 2016, the sessions were supercharged with hard-won live experience from endless street-level shows and relentless midnight-to-six rehearsals at the Buttertones lock-out, then focused even further by the insight and vision of producer Jonny Bell. (“Jonny pushed us like crazy,” says Boettcher. “He had so many ideas all he time.”)It kicks off with “Pistol Whip” and “Sadie’s A Sadist,” twin tales of love and crime that match outré Dangerhouse Records punk (the dirty surf of the Alleycats, the slash-and-burn sax of the Deadbeats) to an urgent rock ‘n’ roll rhythm section and lyrics about what happens when you get into something you can’t get out of. “Neon Cowboy” is a weird-Western Wall of Voodoo take on that expansive Ennio Morricone soundtrack sound, then “I Ran Away” is heartbroken East Side Story sweet soul and “Geisha’s Gaze” is a sleazy popcorn-style R&B slow burner. It’s zig-zag through the wild parts of music—the kind of road trip that Iggy Pop was on in Repo Man or the kind where Lux Interior picked up Poison Ivy hitchhiking—and it ends with a climax and a cliffhanger both. That's the nervous-but-nasty title track “Gravediggin’,” a pedal-to-the-metal instrumental that goes blasting over the edge of the world into a dazed slow-mo fade, with just enough time between freefall and impact for Araiza to sing, “I've been treading my way through another haze / Tossed my heart to the wind …” Think of it this way: you might not yet know how the band that made Gravediggin’ is going to land—but you know it’s going to hit hard.","locationName":"Amoeba Hollywood","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/buttertones-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","date":"April 13","address":"6400 Sunset Blvd Los Angeles CA 90028","type":"Music"},{"name":"Jackknife Comedy L.A.","summary":"The popular NYC comedy show JACKKNIFE COMEDY is coming to LA for ONE NIGHT ONLY on Thursday April 13th at 7pm at the NerdMelt Showroom!","locationName":"NerdMelt Showroom","detailPage":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/jackknife-comedy-la","date":"April 13","address":"7522 W.
