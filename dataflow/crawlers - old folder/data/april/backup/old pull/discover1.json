It was declared a National Historic Landmark on July 27, 1984. The Coliseum has also hosted Evil Knievel in 1973, a Papal Mass by Pope John Paul II in 1987, Nelson Mandela's Crusade against Apartheid in 1990 & countless sold out concerts including U2, Pink Floyd, The Who, Metallica, Bruce Springsteen & the Rolling Stones.
