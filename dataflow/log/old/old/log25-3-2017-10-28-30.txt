In Manhattan, the No Wave scene gave birth to such abrasively noisy and defiantly anti-rock combos as Lydia Lunch’s 8-Eyed Spy and funky post-punks Bush Tetras. One of the most charismatic No Wave performers was James Chance, a brash saxophonist-vocalist who led a series of bands that melded James Brown–inspired funk grooves with an arty, Beefheart-like angularity. As leader of James Chance & the Contortions, he perfected an approach that was busy and claustrophobic but always brainy and danceable. He brings the Contortions back to L.A. for the first time since 1982.","location":"@ The Echoplex","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/james-chance-and-the-contortions-collapsing-scenery-traps-ps-7980940","date":"March 19","type":"Alternative Funk Jazz Punk Rock","locationAddress":"1154 Glendale Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90026 213-413-8200","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330888"},{"name":"Blow Out Blow Out","summary":"By Michael Nordine The term \"Hitchcockian\" is used to describe thrillers so often that it's practically lost its meaning at this point, but few have earned it quite like Brian De Palma.

Within moments of the curtain being raised, the audience gasped audibly and began applauding — before any of the dancers had made even the simplest leap or pirouette. The crowd was awed by its first glimpse of Ryden’s grandly beautiful set, a multistory painting that depicted a bucolic forest wonderland bordered by a quaintly rustic church. Looking like an overgrown stuffed animal, a ridiculously cute toy white horse with a cartoonish pink mane towed an ornately styled carriage of children to a Viennese pastry shop. The pastry shop was even more fantastic, as fanciful marzipan soldiers, gingerbread men and flowery nymphs spilled forth from boxes and jars of tea and coffee arrayed on the large countertop of a colorfully vibrant pink playhouse. Swaddled in a skirt layered with green leaves and crowned with a pink floral wreath, Princess Tea Flower (Stella Abrera) was wooed by the dashing Prince Cocoa (Joseph Gorak), Don Zucchero (Blaine Hoven) and Prince Coffee (David Hallberg) before succumbing coyly to the latter’s heroic charms. The nonstop circuslike visual distractions were heightened by Ratmansky’s often-thrilling choreography. Flower-girl ballerinas flitted about the large stage in airy, elegantly threaded, hummingbird-like sorties. Dancers converged in knotty huddles and burst outward again like psychedelic blooming petals. Abrera picked up her knees and did a jiglike dance that made the flowery tendrils tied to the ragged-leaf-shaped hem of her skirt fly upward like synchronized fuzzy dice. ABT’s production is based on Richard Strauss’ overlooked 1924 ballet Schlagobers, and the German composer’s score is something of a revelation. At first, Pacific Symphony sounded a little muted, boxed in by Segerstrom Hall’s orchestra pit, but conductor Ormsby Wilkins finessed the musicians through Strauss’ boisterous, ebullient melodies. Wilkins and the Orange County orchestra were especially attuned during some of the more oddly intimate and quietly affecting passages. Opening night attracted a near-capacity crowd that included such celebrities as Dita Von Teese and Aaron Paul. Candy glowed like shiny gems in bowls in the lobby, and the merch table of Rydenesque paraphernalia was protected by a velvet rope that corralled a long line of fans — some of whom had driven or flown in from out of state. The plot centered on a nameless boy (Daniil Simkin) who gets sick and passes out from eating too much whipped cream, but not before he witnesses the surreal parade of battling confections, mythical creatures, adorable toys and sentient flora. The boy ends up in a hospital run by a sadistic, boozy doctor (Alexei Agoudine) who’s ensconced in a creepy, gigantic-headed outfit before he’s rescued by the wiles and trickery of enchanting Princess Praline (an impressively lithe Sarah Lane on Wednesday night; the cast varies at each performance). The story echoes Tchaikovsky’s venerable The Nutcracker, but Strauss’ music possesses its own distinct allure. Ratmansky’s inventive flight plans made vintage versions of Schlagobers seem campy, stiff and inept in comparison. And each of Ryden’s spectacular backdrops was seemingly followed by an even more astonishing tableau vivant. A blinking blue eyeball presided over a black ocean filled with stars and protozoa. Bellhops were decked out in burgundy suits with vertical black stripes that accented the sinuous twists of their legs. A coven of dancers wrapped in snow-white veils slowly unfolded their arms, evoking the slow swirl of whipped cream. Sexy nurses impaled the boy in his bed with a spiderlike weave of bazooka-size needles. Gumball Lady (Clementine Greely) was imposing in a floor-length gown of stacked red globes, and Mademoiselle Marianne Chartreuse (Catherine Hurlin) wore a shiny pink foil headpiece shaped like a cork as she led a trio of dancing liquor bottles. And, in addition to the white-and-pink giraffe who loomed quizzically over the dancers like a big candy cane, it was plushie heaven as a giant pink yak (Pierce Bryant) and an even larger snow yak (Anthony Jackson & Mariana Vargas) slowly patrolled the stage like furry mammoths, batting their oversized eyes with doll-like eyelashes. With such delightful music, choreography and design, ABT’s production of Whipped Cream has all the potential to be a massively popular perennial, a kind of postmodern Nutracker. But will the ever-restless Ratmansky and Ryden repeat themselves long enough for that to ever end up happening? It seems just as likely that this madly brilliant ballet will been seen in just a handful of cities before it disappears into the foamy haze of dreams like its title.","location":"@ Segerstrom Hall","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/american-ballet-theatres-whipped-cream-8038248","date":"March 19","type":"Dance Chamber Music Classical","locationAddress":"600 Town Center Dr. Costa Mesa, CA 92626 714-556-2787","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed34533088d"},{"name":"PaleyFest PaleyFest","summary":"By Siran Babayan Spend the week with zombies, superheroes, doctors and robots from the Old West at The Paley Center for Media’s twice-yearly PaleyFest.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","location":"@ Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"March 19","type":"Theater","locationAddress":"1089 N.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Los Alamos Rolodex: Doing Business With the National Lab...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Edward Grothus used to work as a technician at the Los Alamos National Lab, which worked on the atomic bomb. But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 19","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed34533089f"},{"name":"ASSSSCAT ASSSSCAT","summary":"By Zachary Pincus-Roth UCB's flagship improv night featuring a rotating cast of UCB greats, such as Matt Besser, Ian Roberts, Matt Walsh, Sean Conroy, Lauren Lapkus, Joe Wengert and Zach Woods, plus special guest improvisers and monologist.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","location":"@ The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"March 19","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453308a1"},{"name":"Âme Âme","summary":"By Matt Miner German DJ/producer duo Âme captured the hearts of clubgoers worldwide in 2005 with the melodic house anthem “Rej.” That massive, omnipresent single, which was featured on dozens of compilations, was one of the first releases on Innervisions, the label they run with Dixon, which stands today as one of dance music’s most noteworthy imprints.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","location":"@ Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"March 20","type":"Theater","locationAddress":"1089 N.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","location":"@ Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"March 20","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","locationAddress":"601 S.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","location":"@ The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"March 20","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453308f6"},{"name":"Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen Hot Tub with Kurt and Kristen","summary":"By Julie Seabaugh Formerly housed at Littlefield in Gowanus, Brooklyn, the stand-up show Hot Tub has moved across the country and into new digs.

Their most recent album, Generation Doom, is a furious blast of genre-defying rap-metal. While the band emerged during the nu-metal revolution, when rap and metal were becoming natural bedfellows, Otep was nothing like Limp Bizkit. Shamaya’s lyrics are intelligent — often personal, always thought-provoking. In the face of this new administration, she has been out marching in protest, and that anger is bound to translate to her music and live performances. In other words, if you think Otep were pissed off before, you ain’t seen nothing yet.","location":"@ Whisky A Go-Go","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/otep-the-convalescence-the-world-over-7795328","date":"March 20","type":"Metal Rap Rock","locationAddress":"8901 Sunset Blvd. West Hollywood, CA 90069 310-652-4202","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453308f8"},{"name":"Cool Blue Cool Blue","summary":"","location":"@ Las Hadas","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cool-blue-4290940","date":"March 20","type":"Music Jazz","locationAddress":"9048 Balboa Blvd. Northridge, CA 91325 818-892-7271","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453308f9"},{"name":"Monday Social Monday Social","summary":"","location":"@ Sound Nightclub","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/monday-social-4291038","date":"March 20","type":"Music EDM DJ","locationAddress":"1642 N.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 21","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","location":"@ LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"March 21","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330989"},{"name":"STARTS TOMORROW!

The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 21","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole. The leaning wall, held up just by gravity, looks as though it could topple at any moment.","location":"@ Mier Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kilian-r-themann-motion-with-7784062","date":"March 21","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"1107 Greenacre Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046 323-498-5957","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed34533098e"},{"name":"The Hottest Stars at PaleyFest LA The Hottest Stars at PaleyFest LA","summary":"Promotional Event Description The Hottest Stars at PaleyFest LA Fan Up, LA!

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 21","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","location":"@ Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"March 22","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453309a7"},{"name":"\"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\" \"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\"","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart In 1997, Mexico City­–based rock photographer Fernando Aceves was contacted by a concert promoter and offered the chance to document David Bowie's first and only visit to Mexico.

Co-organized by Pixar Animation Studios and Museum of Science, Boston, the exhibit includes eight, themed and interactive sections – “Modeling, Rigging, Surfaces, Sets & Camera, Animation, Simulation, Lighting and Rendering” – each focusing on an aspect of the filmmaking process, as well as first-hand accounts from Pixar employees and cast members and life-size recreations of Buzz Lightyear, Dory, Mike and Sulley, WALL-E and other characters.","location":"@ California Science Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-science-behind-pixar-exhibition-7463530","date":"March 22","type":"Family Film Museums","locationAddress":"700 Exposition Park Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90037 323-724-3623","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453309a9"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week. Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","location":"@ Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"March 22","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","locationAddress":"601 S.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens. Over the course of a year, the exhibit will shuffle through the entire collection.See our full story about the Tree of Testimony.Check website for hours.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","location":"@ Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"March 22","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","location":"@ The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"March 22","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed3453309ae"},{"name":"Cro-Mags, The Last Gang, The Eulogy, Love Canal Cro-Mags, The Last Gang, The Eulogy, Love Canal","summary":"By Paul Rogers For West Coasters nostalgic for the golden age of NYC hardcore, this is about as close as you’ll get. While Cro-Mags’ bewildering lineup changes and public bickering for years overshadowed their actual music, the current (apparently stable) incarnation features 40 percent of the quintessential crew that recorded their genre-igniting 1986 debut, The Age of Quarrel. Though it was now-absent guitarist Parris Mayhew’s metal-edged riffs that set the album apart, returned Age of Quarrel alumni John Joseph (vocals) and Mackie (drums) also were a huge part of its gritty glory. The former’s versatile, confrontational ranting and the latter’s deceptively groovy battering were intrinsic to the deliciously visceral joys of battle-scarred assaults like “Street Justice” and “World Peace.” Thirty years later, Cro-Mags still all but define hardcore’s most adventurous era.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 22","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 22","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 23","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 23","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

Martha Rosler, Alfredo Jaar, Catherine Opie, South African artist Adam Broomberg and others take images from all points of the 20th-century experience — ranging from news headlines to bourgeois living to in-depth visual studies of people who report the news — and transform them into something greater and more insightful than they ever were expected to be originally.","location":"@ The Getty Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/breaking-news-turning-the-lens-on-mass-media-7702900","date":"March 24","type":"Museums","locationAddress":"1200 Getty Center Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90049 310-440-7300","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330a5b"},{"name":"\"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\"","summary":"By Matt Stromberg Los Angeles is home to a thriving Iranian community — the largest outside of Iran — where traditional Persian customs, music, art and cuisine are kept alive. The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life. The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","location":"@ Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"March 24","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330a5c"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...

Two labels on the wall flank the painting, each offering a different interpretation. The painting confronts the man's “urban modernity” and suggests “progress comes with sacrifice,” explains one label. The other label declares that the painting “fundamentally criticizes the effects of so-called ‘progress’ and ‘modernization,’ ideological catch words in Soviet society.” Similar dueling wall labels “explain” every work in the show, all of which were created during the Cold War, an exercise that shows how slanted and loaded official interpretation can be.","location":"@ The Wende Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/questionable-history-7415001","date":"March 24","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5741 Buckingham , Ste.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 24","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330a63"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","location":"@ Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"March 24","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"3006 W.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 24","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","location":"@ Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"March 24","type":"Dance Theater","locationAddress":"544 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 24","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","location":"@ Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"March 25","type":"Theater","locationAddress":"1089 N.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 25","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330ac0"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

It's a more personalized experience than most museums around town, and educational too — you'll leave understanding why we designate letters \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase,\" and whence came the oft-bandied about entertainment industry term \"slugline.\" (Only open to the public on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., other times are by appointment)","location":"@ International Printing Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/international-printing-museum-4290963","date":"March 25","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"315 W.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","location":"@ The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"March 25","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330ac7"},{"name":"Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks Patricia Fernandez's Point of Departure: Five Walks","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Over the past three years, artist Patricia Fernandez, who lives in L.A. but was born in Spain, took five walks through the Pyrenees mountains that separate Spain from France. She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","location":"@ Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"March 25","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"3006 W.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 25","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","location":"@ Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"March 25","type":"Dance Theater","locationAddress":"544 N.

The exhibit features (through May 21 only) two pages of the original document on loan from the National Archives, as well as the Presidential Proclamation 2537 signed on Jan. 14, 1942 that required aliens from Germany, Italy and Japan to register with the U.S. Department of Justice. The display also includes additional historical documents, documentary videos and contemporary artwork by Wendy Maruyama and Mike Saijo. Throughout the exhibit the museum will host tours, workshops, performances and an outdoor art piece.","location":"@ Japanese American National Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/instructions-to-all-persons-reflections-on-executive-order-9066-7920939","date":"March 26","type":"Education Museums","locationAddress":"100 N.

The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life. The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","location":"@ Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"March 26","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330b1a"},{"name":"\"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\" \"David Bowie: Among the Mexican Masters\"","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart In 1997, Mexico City­–based rock photographer Fernando Aceves was contacted by a concert promoter and offered the chance to document David Bowie's first and only visit to Mexico.

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","location":"@ Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"March 26","type":"Comedy","locationAddress":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330b20"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Los Alamos Rolodex: Doing Business With the National Lab...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Edward Grothus used to work as a technician at the Los Alamos National Lab, which worked on the atomic bomb. But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 26","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330b24"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","location":"@ LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"March 26","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330b63"},{"name":"STARTS TOMORROW!

The Super Variety Match Bonus Round!","summary":"Rogue Machine (“Best Production” - three seasons - Ovation, and Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards) presents the World Premiere of THE SUPER VARIETY MATCH BONUS ROUND! by Deb Hiett. “A sure-shot writer … bold new voice,” wrote the Village Voice about Deb Hiett’s play Words in a Certain Order, at NYC’s Dixon Place. Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination. That is no easy feat.\" – Cameron Watson, Director The Super Variety Match Bonus Round! opens at 8:30pm on November 12th and runs at 8:30pm Saturdays and Mondays, 3pm on Sundays through December 19, 2016.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 26","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","location":"@ Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"March 26","type":"Dance Theater","locationAddress":"544 N.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","location":"@ Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"March 27","type":"Theater","locationAddress":"1089 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 27","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","location":"@ LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"March 27","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330b92"},{"name":"L.A.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 28","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","location":"@ LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"March 28","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330bfb"},{"name":"Ron Nagle: Ice Breaker Ron Nagle: Ice Breaker","summary":"Matthew Marks is pleased to announce Ron Nagle: Ice Breaker, the next exhibition in his gallery at 1062 North Orange Grove.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","location":"@ Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330c16"},{"name":"Ten Times Funnier Comedy Show Ten Times Funnier Comedy Show","summary":"Where Will You Be Laughing Tuesday Nights?

Martha Rosler, Alfredo Jaar, Catherine Opie, South African artist Adam Broomberg and others take images from all points of the 20th-century experience — ranging from news headlines to bourgeois living to in-depth visual studies of people who report the news — and transform them into something greater and more insightful than they ever were expected to be originally.","location":"@ The Getty Center","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/breaking-news-turning-the-lens-on-mass-media-7702900","date":"March 29","type":"Museums","locationAddress":"1200 Getty Center Dr. Los Angeles, CA 90049 310-440-7300","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330c27"},{"name":"The Science Behind Pixar Exhibition The Science Behind Pixar Exhibition","summary":"By Siran Babayan Ever wonder how children’s animated movies are made?

Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 29","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 29","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole. The leaning wall, held up just by gravity, looks as though it could topple at any moment.","location":"@ Mier Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kilian-r-themann-motion-with-7784062","date":"March 29","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"1107 Greenacre Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046 323-498-5957","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330c58"},{"name":"Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica","summary":"Photo Ceramica is the first major exhibition of photographer and ceramicist Peter Olson. Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 29","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art.

Joined at this weekly sit-down jam by the likes of formidable guitar slingers Carmine Sardo and Cody Bryant, pianist Skip Edwards and local hero Ronnie Mack, Maness is in the ideal setting, and the results are invariably stunning.","location":"@ Cody's Viva Cantina","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jay-dee-maness-cody-bryant-carmine-sardo-ronnie-mack-6741578","date":"March 30","type":"Country Rock","locationAddress":"900 Riverside Dr. Burbank, CA 91506 818-848-8810","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330c88"},{"name":"Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives","summary":"From the website: \"one of our nation's most important collections of art from Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and the Americas...features approximately 250 of the finest objects from the Fowler's collections in a long-term exhibition that celebrates the richness of world arts and considers the roles these works of art play in peoples' lives.\"","location":"@ Fowler Museum at UCLA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/intersections-world-arts-local-lives-4291083","date":"March 30","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture Museums","locationAddress":"Sunset & Westwood blvds.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole. The leaning wall, held up just by gravity, looks as though it could topple at any moment.","location":"@ Mier Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kilian-r-themann-motion-with-7784062","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"1107 Greenacre Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046 323-498-5957","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330cb2"},{"name":"Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica","summary":"Photo Ceramica is the first major exhibition of photographer and ceramicist Peter Olson. Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 30","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","location":"@ The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"945 Chung King Rd.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330ce0"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole. The leaning wall, held up just by gravity, looks as though it could topple at any moment.","location":"@ Mier Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kilian-r-themann-motion-with-7784062","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"1107 Greenacre Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046 323-498-5957","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330d1f"},{"name":"Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica","summary":"Photo Ceramica is the first major exhibition of photographer and ceramicist Peter Olson. Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 31","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","location":"@ Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"March 31","type":"Dance Theater","locationAddress":"544 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art. After his mother died and the family house was sold, he moved into a retirement home in Chicago, where he died, at the age of sixty-eight, in 1995.","location":"@ The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/charles-steffen-7254820","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"945 Chung King Rd.

The genre-defying Police Academy alum has been on the creative fast track over the past several months unleashing his one-of-a-kind brand of comedy in his new Showtime special “You Don’t Look the Same Either” and his newest movie “God Bless America.” In his newest special Bobcat returns with a self-deprecating and topical instant comedy classic taking the audience on a hilarious journey through his 30 year career as an eighties icon to the guy who lit the Tonight Show set on fire…literally! And Goldthwait’s inimitable talent for writing and directing is clearly displayed in his newest movie which definitely has America talking. Bobcat’s off-the-beaten-path style of creating movies allows audiences to experience films that other artists may have never dared to attempt. He has come a long way since his first film “Shakes the Clown” and has created many more including “Windy City Heat” which Matt Stone (co-creator of South Park) called “beyond genius.”","location":"Hollywood Improv (The Lab)","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/crabapples-bobcat-goldthwait-caitlin-gill-more-3","locationAddress":"8162 Melrose Avenue, Hollywood, us\\","date":"March 14","type":" / Arts & Theatre      ","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330d97"},{"name":"The Mark Hix Big Band, featuring Meloney Collins","summary":"Mark Hix is a native of Venice, California and he formed his Big Band in 1995 and has been performing in Los Angeles and Orange Counties ever since.

It is a visual celebration of moments captured by photographer Ara Madzounian during his 2008-2009 visit to the Bourj Hammoud district, a geographical extension of Beirut, Lebanon. Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide began migrating to the area as refugees. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes, it was here where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war. Most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Bourj Hammoud is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over a hundred years ago against the Armenian people.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/birds-nest-opening-photography-exhibit-about-bourj-hammoud","locationAddress":"415 E.

The Bouncing Souls are nothing short of a legacy, and with their new release \"Simplicity\" they're showing just why they've become one of the most respected and appreciated punk bands of all time. For their newest album, \"Simplicity\", The Bouncing Souls headed back into the studio with John Seymour (who previously produced \"How I Spent My Summer Vacation\" and \"Anchors Aweigh\") to craft their highly anticipated new album. Simplicity is easily the band's strongest, most anthemic material to date. The Bouncing Souls will be on tour all year to support the release, as well as headlining major festivals around the world.

The six tracks perfectly showcase his intelligent wordplay and social commentary that he has become synonymous for. The palpable sense of excitement has seen his debut UK headline tour sell out within 30 minutes after going on sale, not to mention gaining famous friends such as Drake who recently remixed the track Wanna Know. He made his debut appearance on Black Box, a YouTube channel for freestyle rap in May 2015. That November he performed on SB.TV’s “Warm Up Session”. This is a multi-faceted British company with its own YouTube channel specializing in urban music, as well has interviewed Prime Minister David Cameron and HRH Prince Charles. He has performed on BBC Radio 1 Charlie Sloth’s show “Fire in the Booth”, which is regarded as a real mark of prestige in the scene. He has already performed at Bestival, a four-day award winning music festival that has been held annually since 2004. In addition, he was a part of the Red Bull Music Academy UK tour last October (a world-traveling series of music workshops and festivals, founded in 1998. The main five-week event is held in a different city each year. The public portion of its program is a festival of concerts, art installations, club nights and lectures by influential figures in contemporary music). Summer 2017 will see Dave perform at prestigious European festivals including Glastonbury, Wireless and Reading & Leeds (UK), Appelsap (Netherlands), Melt Festival (Germany) and Secret Solstice (Iceland).","location":"The Roxy","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/dave-x-aj-tracey-0","locationAddress":"9009 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles 90069, us\\","date":"March 19","type":" / Music      ","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330e46"},{"name":"Yellowcard","summary":"An American pop punk band that was formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1997 and based in Los Angeles since 2000.[5] The band is well known for its singles \"Ocean Avenue\", \"Only One\", and \"Lights and Sounds\".

Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life. Signing space is limited to purchasers of Häxan.Performing at The Getty Center on 3/21.In between the release of Dungen’s most recent two albums (2010’s Skit i allt and 2015’s Allas sak), the beloved Stockholm quartet was asked to create an original score to Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 touchstone The Adventures of Prince Achmed, understood to be the oldest surviving full-length animated feature film. Inspired by the work and the characters – Prince Achmed, Peri Banu, Aladdin, the Sorcerer, and most of all, the Witch – the members of Dungen immersed themselves into the groundbreaking visual language of this landmark silent film.Häxan (translation: “The Witch”) is Dungen’s first all-instrumental album. Produced by Mathias Glavå, and recorded, mixed, and edited by hand to tape entirely in the analog domain, Häxan was sequenced away from the linear narrative of the film. This process helped to create a path of its own, fully capturing the rawness and spontaneity present in the sessions, as well as a loose, abstract, and fragmented collage feel, evident in the dense and dissonant free-form rock-outs, haunting ambient passages, and gorgeously cinematic soundscapes present in the work, a record that stands on its own outside of the presence of its primary inspiration.Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life, Häxan provides both a tacit summation of the Dungen journey up to today, and gives the beloved group a chance to stretch out like never before.","location":"Amoeba Hollywood","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/dungen-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","locationAddress":"6400 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles 90028, us\\","date":"March 22","type":" / Music      ","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330ebf"},{"name":"Funk Jazz Wednesday","summary":"ALL SEATS MUST ARRIVE BY 7PM.

He is an independent producer, director and cinematographer based in Los Angeles. He holds a BA and MFA in Film & Television from UCLA. For eight years he has produced Armenia Fund Telethon. He has also produced educational videos for Los Angeles County Refugee Project. He made his screen-acting debut on ShowTime in Radio Inside, a feature film. Ara has lectured on Armenian Cinema at the ARS Summer Studies Program at Amherst and Bradford colleges in Massachusetts. He has produced and directed over thirty television commercials and many corporate films. His latest feature cinematography work Meltdown was released in 2015. Ara is currently working with the Smithsonian Institution on a project that harnesses the power of storytelling to strengthen cultural heritage sustainability called My Armenia.   The Bourj Hammoud district in Lebanon is the geographical extension of Beirut City along the Mediterranean coastline. It constitutes the suburb immediately east of the capital, by the seaside-separated by the Beirut River. Housing a population of roughly 100,000 persons, it is a dense working class district, extending over an area of 0.96 square-miles or 2.4 km2 within the Greater Beirut municipality.  Until the early twentieth century, Bourj Hammoud was an area characterized by agriculture and marshlands, scattered with individual settlements. After 1928, Armenian refugees who survived the Ottoman persecutions began migrating to the area, settling in compact quarters organized into regular gridiron patterns. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland in Anatolia, modern day Turkey, which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis.  In the mid nineteen-forties, part of the Armenian population migrated to Soviet Armenia, followed by another influx of migrants from south Lebanon-mainly Shiites and some Palestinians, whom settled predominantly throughout the southeastern edges of the district. In the sixties, Bourj Hammoud witnessed an influx of Armenians from Syria, mainly Aleppo, who settled in the area and established their small businesses.  Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war’s ongoing development. The influx of displaced populations from conflict zones and hostile areas, and emigrants from rural areas-mainly Armenians from Beirut and Christians displaced from their villages, coupled with the displacement of Shiite inhabitants, progressed the continual densification of Bourj Hammoud’s population.  My parents, both survivors of the 1915 Armenian genocide, met and were married in Damascus, Syria, only to relocate their family to Bourj Hammoud in 1949. It is here I was born and lived there for 20 years before permanently moving out at the start of the civil war in 1975.  Bourj Hammoud became a safe haven for many Armenians who were forced to leave their homes and subsequently converge in this one square mile territory to create a home away from home. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes were a part of the effort to maintain a level of subsistence. It was here, also, where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. From 1935 to 1985 this tiny enclave served as the cultural, intellectual and political beacon of the Armenian Diaspora.  During the course of a 15-year conflict, most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Today, like many dwindling Christian communities across the Middle East, Bourj Hammoud struggles to retain its Armenian character against the tide of political uncertainty engulfing the region. More than 50 years Bourj Hammoud played a pivotal role in preserving the Armenian national identity. This important place-often called Little Armenia-this colony is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over hundred years ago against Armenian population living in their homeland.  Between 2008-2009, I returned to my hometown twice to be with my terminally ill older brother who had lived all his life in Bourj Hammoud. The district has gone through dramatic changes; not only in terms of becoming an important commercial hub but also due to the migration of its predominantly Armenian population, whose distinctive mark of character is disappearing from the area.  Each resident of this suburb can offer a plethora of interesting and enchanting stories-in this book are only some of the many images captured during my visit to this special place. My intimate relationships with its narrow streets, the sights and sounds, and its peculiar characters have all been an important source of inspiration all my life.  This book is my story, a tribute to all residents of Bourj Hammoud.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/meet-ara-mazdounian-author-birds-nest","locationAddress":"415 E.

Laced with musical sequences and cinematic style, ELEVATOR is a comedic and emotional ride into the human psyche and asks the fundamental question: who are you behind closed doors?","location":"Coast Playhouse","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/elevator-2","locationAddress":"8325 Santa Monica Blvd., CA 90069, us\\","date":"March 26","type":" / Arts & Theater      ","_id":"58d6a8bd9444bed345330f90"},{"name":"Je'Caryous Johnson's \"Married But Single Too\"","summary":"Click here to see the stage from your seat!

Deep family tensions and old rivalries resurface as the brothers struggle to follow the hundreds-years-old “Code of Dueling.” Runs March 16-April 15 at The Los Angeles Theatre Center, 514 S.

But did you know that Cheech—which is not his real name—is also the owner of the most renowned collection of Chicano art in the world? Did you know that before he became a face of the recreational drug movement, he grew up the son of a cop? Did you know that he crushed Anderson Cooper on Celebrity Jeopardy!? In his long-awaited memoir, this counterculture legend writes candidly about coming-of-age as the wisecracking kid in 1960s Los Angeles, resisting the draft as a young man, and many other surprising journeys along the way of creating one of the most successful comedy acts of all time.
