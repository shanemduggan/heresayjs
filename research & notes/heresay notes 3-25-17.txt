Database flow


> Run crawls
> Load event data in to collection

Currently need to save events after all crawls have been completed
Events have location name and address


> Create json file for locations and get lat/lng

Create file with just location names and addresses
Run geocoding on these and save to db



> How to associate event location with location collection


Now we have roughly 2,000 geocoded locations



> Associating locations and events

_id: "The EchoPlex"

location_id: "The EchoPlex"


{
   _id: "joe",
}

{
   patron_id: "joe",
   street: "123 Fake Street",
}

Get all events from date
Get all locations for events







> Load event data into db for storage (done)

> Geocode addresses and save locations

> Build up db of locations
  - 2000 locations currently

> No more markers on load, implementing date filter - create marker cluster for dates

> Alleviate front end from having to geocode everytime

> Important to cache location addresses and their coordiantes
