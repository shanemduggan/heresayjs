If he doesn't do anything too evil, he might be idolized like crazy in future generations as one of the greatest characters of the capitalist era.

Musk, Bezos, and Gates, among many others could probably be seen as our modern-day "Captains of Industry."

At the time of their careers there were not considered nice people. Bill Gates didn't start his career by being a nice guy, nor did Rockefeller, both were cut-throat in their competitive actions. Both in their later years though dedicated their entire lives to giving away their money.

goal: full autonomy for data
solution: run crawlers at 8pm-4pm
		   run data parser / geo

data flow
	1. data parse / geocode
	2. put in correct place (test)
	3. push to git & mongo
	4. logging issues (add to step 1, test)







Timeline
--------------------------------
Improve crawler run experience / Data flow
	> data clean up > geo unique locs 
	> create necessary files > push to git

UI improvements

Show app / Get feedback / Take break from development 
--------------------------------

June: 			data flow optimization & testing 
				refine UI / chris feedback & mockups
				friend launch



ui
` move date and buttons on same line
` put location below


data flow
` location utils (test)
	- retrieveMonthLocations()
	- locationsToGeocode()
` geocode (test end, add logging)
	- when geocode done
` location utils
	- combine location files (dynamic)



		





















Update on flow:
	> then run data parsing / geocoding flow (re-test)
	> logging
		- log how many locations didnt get geo'd
		- how many events, locations, unique locations
		- any errors
	> think about a way to save intermittedly better
		- only events, no empty data in files
		- read them and concact














Backlog:
> see if i can reduce wait time for geocoding from 5 sec	
> other server side data clean up or normalization
> begin work on logging (timestamp, message)
	- when different phases are done
	- files saved
	- errors
	- amt of data
		> do not log actual data
> try to create full data flow in batch
	- clean up step 1&2
	- end of step3 we can save files and get final versions
	- put data in github folder & push
	 	> step 3 for batch file?
> 	re-work how crawl data is saved (test)
> creating marker clean up
		- doubling in showCard & placeMarkers
> logging handle objects & test



chris giving me:
	- mockups (nav, card, general)
	- logo designs




>>> figure out why markers have low numbers <<<
	- most addresses in historic data
	- some issues with data geo need to be fixed


create list of addresses not found
search all location data 
	if found
		where are they being filtered
	if not found
		why aren't they being geod




Next steps
0. express sample set up (query both collections)
	> work on getting location data from events
		- need to save it to new array
		- look through april events
		   find loc doc in db
		   update event object with location information
0. set up heroku to host crawler 



I. brainstorm where to go from here
	> server
	> db? (save addresses)
	> themes / filtering
II. server research (aws, heroku)
III. function to handle response & errors
	- add in secondCallback
