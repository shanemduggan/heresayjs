mlab can hold  roughly 500k docs (1 mill docs is 1.29 gig)
geocode api 2500/day cap
json handle ~3900 parent events
laweekly ~3100 events @ 100/day, 300 child/hr
			parent: 1 hr; child: 12+ hr			
discover ~ 1300 events, full: 6.5 hr
timeout ~ 140 events (7 min)
overall crawl length: estimating 15 hr for full crawl

If he doesn't do anything too evil, he might be idolized like crazy in future generations as one of the greatest characters of the capitalist era.

Musk, Bezos, and Gates, among many others could probably be seen as our modern-day "Captains of Industry."

At the time of their careers there were not considered nice people. Bill Gates didn't start his career by being a nice guy, nor did Rockefeller, both were cut-throat in their competitive actions. Both in their later years though dedicated their entire lives to giving away their money.

Notes for crawl exp:

goal: full autonomy for data
i.e. i can run it on 1st day without any changes required

data flow
	1. get data (run crawler)
	2. normalize data
	3. unique locations 
	4. geocode
	5. concat files
	6. put in specific folders
	7. push to mongo required?
	8. logging issues







Timeline
--------------------------------
Improve crawler run experience

Data flow
	> crawl > data clean up > geo unique locs 
	> create necessary files > push to git

UI improvements (share / cards)

Show app / Get feedback / Take break from development 
--------------------------------

2. hover on marker refine
	> show tooltip
	> clear card info on click


> card show/hide after expanding sidebar
> clean out marker array
> center / animate marker on sidebar click



3. share on facebook button

In geocode
Step 4. Geocode locations (in progress - stopped at 500)
	> call this in location utils?

In location utils
Step 5. Create months location file








Flow / Function calls

1. crawl
	> when laweekly done
2. location utils
	> retrieveMonthLocations()
	> locationsToGeocode()
3. geocode
	> when geocode done
4. location utils
	> combine location files
	> move file to correct folder
5. data utils
	> combine event files
	> move file to correct folder








>>>>>>>>>>				 To do:       <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
	> create utils (location) as export object
	> make geocode as export object
	> dynamic location utils
	> dynamic geocode








may geocode - stopped at ~500
	> err: over query limit





new folder structure:
	data (location & crawl data)
	dataflow (utils, geocode, crawlers)


>> create logging util
>> dynamic location utils





next steps
	- data parsing
	- db push
	- file concat







Backlog:
> location file (reduce arrays so no duplicates)
> need to do data manipulation pre-client (on types, etc.)
> instead of saving as index % saveIndex, make more descriptive
  i.e. start and end point
> see if i can reduce wait time for geocoding from 5 sec	
> personal map
	- + icon besides ul items
	- remove from my list






Next steps
0. express sample set up (query both collections)
	> work on getting location data from events
		- need to save it to new array
		- look through april events
		   find loc doc in db
		   update event object with location information
0. set up heroku to host crawler 



I. brainstorm where to go from here
	> server
	> db? (save addresses)
	> themes / filtering
II. server research (aws, heroku)
III. function to handle response & errors
	- add in secondCallback
