How to make experience better?
Make other peoples' experiences better?
Make people more comfortable

geocode api 2500/day cap
json handle ~3900 parent events
laweekly ~3100 events @ 100/day, 300 child/hr
			parent: 1 hr; child: 12+ hr			
discover ~ 1300 events, full: 6.5 hr
timeout ~ 140 events (7 min)


overall crawl length:
		> estimating 15 hr for full crawl




mongod --port 27017 --dbpath "C:\data\db"
	> event collection - events03
	> geocoded locations - locationsgeo03

>> set up aws to run crawlers
>> re-work crawlers to run all requests at once

Timeline
--------------------------------
Caching location coordinates (to avoid overloading api)  < current

Take a break from development
Show app / get feedback

Improve crawler run experience

// add clickability on types
// stop old markers from appearing (rework marker adding)
// some names aren't added to marker window
// think about how map / list interation should be










Next steps:
1. re-crawling discover for addresses (on-going)






Saturday:
2. retrieve april locations
	> check db if already geocoded
	  if not, geocode and save to db










Sunday/Next week
3. need to test getting location data on filter
	> see how long it takes to find in json
	> if quick to find all coordinates use json location files for now
4. look into client side mongo (might not be possible)
5. set up heroku to host crawler 






laweekly april - 2670 events
discover april - 
	> 












geocoded march locations (2130)
	> roughly 40 addresses failed to geocode (multiple locations)

















- art type could be up to 1000 events (break apart type)
- mvc rework
	> handle mongo requests from client/model
- need to clean up discover crawler
- can remove a couple node modules 
	> bluebird, pretty?, either @google or node-geocoder (using 1)
	









					STORE LOCATION ADDRESSES
					WILL IMPROVE CRAWL TIMES

















I. brainstorm where to go from here
	> server
	> db? (save addresses)
	> themes / filtering
II. db & server research (online db or json file pref)
	* firebase, couchdb, aws, heroku
III. function to handle response & errors
	- add in secondCallback
