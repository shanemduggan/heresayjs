Bobcat’s off-the-beaten-path style of creating movies allows audiences to experience films that other artists may have never dared to attempt.

It is a visual celebration of moments captured by photographer Ara Madzounian during his 2008-2009 visit to the Bourj Hammoud district, a geographical extension of Beirut, Lebanon. Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide began migrating to the area as refugees. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes, it was here where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war. Most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Bourj Hammoud is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over a hundred years ago against the Armenian people.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/birds-nest-opening-photography-exhibit-about-bourj-hammoud","locationAddress":"415 E.

The six tracks perfectly showcase his intelligent wordplay and social commentary that he has become synonymous for. The palpable sense of excitement has seen his debut UK headline tour sell out within 30 minutes after going on sale, not to mention gaining famous friends such as Drake who recently remixed the track Wanna Know. He made his debut appearance on Black Box, a YouTube channel for freestyle rap in May 2015. That November he performed on SB.TV’s “Warm Up Session”. This is a multi-faceted British company with its own YouTube channel specializing in urban music, as well has interviewed Prime Minister David Cameron and HRH Prince Charles. He has performed on BBC Radio 1 Charlie Sloth’s show “Fire in the Booth”, which is regarded as a real mark of prestige in the scene. He has already performed at Bestival, a four-day award winning music festival that has been held annually since 2004. In addition, he was a part of the Red Bull Music Academy UK tour last October (a world-traveling series of music workshops and festivals, founded in 1998.

Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life. Signing space is limited to purchasers of Häxan.Performing at The Getty Center on 3/21.In between the release of Dungen’s most recent two albums (2010’s Skit i allt and 2015’s Allas sak), the beloved Stockholm quartet was asked to create an original score to Lotte Reiniger’s 1926 touchstone The Adventures of Prince Achmed, understood to be the oldest surviving full-length animated feature film. Inspired by the work and the characters – Prince Achmed, Peri Banu, Aladdin, the Sorcerer, and most of all, the Witch – the members of Dungen immersed themselves into the groundbreaking visual language of this landmark silent film.Häxan (translation: “The Witch”) is Dungen’s first all-instrumental album. Produced by Mathias Glavå, and recorded, mixed, and edited by hand to tape entirely in the analog domain, Häxan was sequenced away from the linear narrative of the film. This process helped to create a path of its own, fully capturing the rawness and spontaneity present in the sessions, as well as a loose, abstract, and fragmented collage feel, evident in the dense and dissonant free-form rock-outs, haunting ambient passages, and gorgeously cinematic soundscapes present in the work, a record that stands on its own outside of the presence of its primary inspiration.Moody, evocative, stormy, and brimming with life, Häxan provides both a tacit summation of the Dungen journey up to today, and gives the beloved group a chance to stretch out like never before.","location":"Amoeba Hollywood","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/dungen-live-performance-signing-free-all-ages","locationAddress":"6400 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles 90028, us\\","date":"March 22","type":" / Music      ","_id":"58d64393f61c3fafc5302e29"},{"name":"Funk Jazz Wednesday","summary":"ALL SEATS MUST ARRIVE BY 7PM.

Reception to follow.  ARA MADZOUNIAN was born in Bourj Hammoud in 1953. He lived there for 20 years until the start of the civil war in 1975. He is an independent producer, director and cinematographer based in Los Angeles. He holds a BA and MFA in Film & Television from UCLA. For eight years he has produced Armenia Fund Telethon. He has also produced educational videos for Los Angeles County Refugee Project. He made his screen-acting debut on ShowTime in Radio Inside, a feature film. Ara has lectured on Armenian Cinema at the ARS Summer Studies Program at Amherst and Bradford colleges in Massachusetts. He has produced and directed over thirty television commercials and many corporate films. His latest feature cinematography work Meltdown was released in 2015. Ara is currently working with the Smithsonian Institution on a project that harnesses the power of storytelling to strengthen cultural heritage sustainability called My Armenia.   The Bourj Hammoud district in Lebanon is the geographical extension of Beirut City along the Mediterranean coastline. It constitutes the suburb immediately east of the capital, by the seaside-separated by the Beirut River. Housing a population of roughly 100,000 persons, it is a dense working class district, extending over an area of 0.96 square-miles or 2.4 km2 within the Greater Beirut municipality.  Until the early twentieth century, Bourj Hammoud was an area characterized by agriculture and marshlands, scattered with individual settlements. After 1928, Armenian refugees who survived the Ottoman persecutions began migrating to the area, settling in compact quarters organized into regular gridiron patterns. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland in Anatolia, modern day Turkey, which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis.  In the mid nineteen-forties, part of the Armenian population migrated to Soviet Armenia, followed by another influx of migrants from south Lebanon-mainly Shiites and some Palestinians, whom settled predominantly throughout the southeastern edges of the district. In the sixties, Bourj Hammoud witnessed an influx of Armenians from Syria, mainly Aleppo, who settled in the area and established their small businesses.  Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war’s ongoing development. The influx of displaced populations from conflict zones and hostile areas, and emigrants from rural areas-mainly Armenians from Beirut and Christians displaced from their villages, coupled with the displacement of Shiite inhabitants, progressed the continual densification of Bourj Hammoud’s population.  My parents, both survivors of the 1915 Armenian genocide, met and were married in Damascus, Syria, only to relocate their family to Bourj Hammoud in 1949. It is here I was born and lived there for 20 years before permanently moving out at the start of the civil war in 1975.  Bourj Hammoud became a safe haven for many Armenians who were forced to leave their homes and subsequently converge in this one square mile territory to create a home away from home. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes were a part of the effort to maintain a level of subsistence. It was here, also, where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. From 1935 to 1985 this tiny enclave served as the cultural, intellectual and political beacon of the Armenian Diaspora.  During the course of a 15-year conflict, most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Today, like many dwindling Christian communities across the Middle East, Bourj Hammoud struggles to retain its Armenian character against the tide of political uncertainty engulfing the region. More than 50 years Bourj Hammoud played a pivotal role in preserving the Armenian national identity. This important place-often called Little Armenia-this colony is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over hundred years ago against Armenian population living in their homeland.  Between 2008-2009, I returned to my hometown twice to be with my terminally ill older brother who had lived all his life in Bourj Hammoud. The district has gone through dramatic changes; not only in terms of becoming an important commercial hub but also due to the migration of its predominantly Armenian population, whose distinctive mark of character is disappearing from the area.  Each resident of this suburb can offer a plethora of interesting and enchanting stories-in this book are only some of the many images captured during my visit to this special place. My intimate relationships with its narrow streets, the sights and sounds, and its peculiar characters have all been an important source of inspiration all my life.  This book is my story, a tribute to all residents of Bourj Hammoud.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/meet-ara-mazdounian-author-birds-nest","locationAddress":"415 E.

Deep family tensions and old rivalries resurface as the brothers struggle to follow the hundreds-years-old “Code of Dueling.” Runs March 16-April 15 at The Los Angeles Theatre Center, 514 S.

In his characteristically flat, sunny way, he depicts shelves full of plants and pots. Some of the pots are the plain old terracotta kind you’d find at Home Depot. Other colorful, patterned ones look handmade. Sky-blue light shines through the shelves on the right, while those on the left could be in some dimly lit closet. Two pots on the darker side are shaped and painted to look like blinged-out, red-cheeked owls.

The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

The contrast between her singing and his abrupt power-chord interjections on “It’s Just Now,” from the Brooklyn duo’s latest album, Jessica Rabbit, is a deliciously dirty collision of sweetness and noise. “Hyper Dark” is an aptly titled soundscape of murky electronics and fuzzy guitar that’s illuminated by Krauss’ gauzily ethereal singing. “Flags tangle in the wind,” she purrs enigmatically while Miller lowers the boom with the sound of distant thunder and insomniac sound effects. Krauss could be describing Miller’s maelstrom of noise when she shouts, “Two tornadoes touch down in Kansas/Instinct takes over … but I’m bleeding profusely.” The pair make even bloodiness seem beautiful.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 28","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

Lasworth’s paintings are a manifestation of masterful control of color, shape and form. Each work rich in surface and content, is coded with symbolism that poignantly addresses themes of life, death and spirituality. The show opens with the artist’s reception on Saturday, July 30th from 5:00 – 7:00 pm. Lasworth is known for her sophisticated use of religious, philosophical and personal symbolism. Her work recalls classical allegory and medieval iconography. She extracts subjects from text, bridging the familiar with the sacred, creating images that are mysterious and otherworldly. Since 2001, her method has resembled that of a long-form writer. In her elaborate cycles of paintings, each panel functions as a chapter. Through the paintings a narrative slowly emerges, coaxing a careful reading. Lasworth’s images echo scripture and sacred history, yet they refrain from didacticism and literalism. Instead her paintings exhibit a respectful melancholy, as if they must span unbridgeable distances. The result is not a sense of futility, but of hope and impending miracle. The event is free and open to the public.","location":"@ Lora Schlesinger Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/after-images-new-paintings-by-laura-lasworth-7089715","date":"March 28","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums Arts & Culture","locationAddress":"2525 Michigan Ave., B5b Santa Monica, CA 90404 310-828-1133","_id":"58d64392f61c3fafc5302b80"},{"name":"Ten Times Funnier Comedy Show Ten Times Funnier Comedy Show","summary":"Where Will You Be Laughing Tuesday Nights?

The second biennial exhibition \"Focus Iran 2: Contemporary Photography and Video\" presents the work of dozens of artists who explore Iranian culture and heritage. An international jury of citizen journalists, archivists and storytellers — who are connected to Iran by ancestry or simple admiration of its culture — selected work by emerging and midcareer artists to reflect the diversity of contemporary Iranian life.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 29","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 29","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 29","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","location":"@ Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"3006 W.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 30","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 30","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","location":"@ Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","_id":"58d64392f61c3fafc5302c4a"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Stefan Heyne SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction...","summary":"SUPER VISION is the first United States solo exhibition of photographs by Berlin-based artist Stefan Heyne. SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","location":"@ Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","locationAddress":"831 N.

Developed by Los Angeles Conservancy, the tour guides visitors through one of the city's oldest neighborhoods with many layers of history and diverse communities. The influx of popular culinary hotspots and art galleries, combined with the area's rich history, makes Chinatown one of L.A.'s most exciting neighborhoods. The tour takes visitors to the Central Plaza in the heart of New Chinatown, and includes decades-old shops selling traditional teas, medicines, and Chinese imports; and places of historic importance in the battle for Chinese-American civil rights.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","location":"@ LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"March 31","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","_id":"58d64392f61c3fafc5302c85"},{"name":"Daniel Pitín: The Mechanical Flowers Daniel Pitín: The Mechanical Flowers","summary":"The paintings of Daniel Pitín are firmly holding on to the eternal distinction between light and darkness. Light, dispersed from an invisible and ungraspable source focuses on the surface of the canvas, piercing through it and finding its way around and reflecting through numerous forms folded into the composition of the image somewhere between architecture, scenography and a vivid inner space. The play of light and darkness is thus the key element of formation of the space, its moods and variability seemingly frozen in the static image on the canvas, yet still breathing with fresh inputs coming from its extraneous environment and ocular abilities of its viewers. The given matter, building blocks of the content stays in the constant flux of transfiguration, with shades of approaching light, through the light, as light itself. Pitín is thus touching field of prefigurations of his work, its main referential points in Czech avant-garde photography of František Drtikol, Jaromir Funke or Josef Sudek, in tradition of cubist painting and even deeper in history, as in baroque paintings through the technique of chiaroscuro, based on strong distinctions between tonal variations, therefore conceiving a dramatic, almost theatrical visual feeling.","location":"@ Nicodim Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/daniel-pit-n-the-mechanical-flowers-7927407","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"571 S.

In the room behind the wall, Rüthemann attached smaller brick rectangles, about the size of windows, to the walls. A wall-length print shows a lone, 100-foot-tall fan palm tree standing in Exposition Park. Rüthemann chose this tree because of its age — 150 years — and the fact that it has been replanted three times over its lifetime. He was interested in how seemingly stationary monuments could also be tractable, and his show does manage to feel transitory on the whole. The leaning wall, held up just by gravity, looks as though it could topple at any moment.","location":"@ Mier Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/kilian-r-themann-motion-with-7784062","date":"March 31","type":"Art Galleries","locationAddress":"1107 Greenacre Ave Los Angeles, CA 90046 323-498-5957","_id":"58d64392f61c3fafc5302c89"},{"name":"Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica Peter Olson: Photo Ceramica","summary":"Photo Ceramica is the first major exhibition of photographer and ceramicist Peter Olson. Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","location":"@ American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"March 31","type":"Art Museums","locationAddress":"399 N.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","location":"@ Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"March 31","type":"Dance Theater","locationAddress":"544 N.

His drawings - in graphite and colored pencil on large sheets of brown paper - possess a unique and timeless quality; they resemble pages from an idiosyncratic self-referential field guide with sunflowers, crucifixions and figures complemented by scrawled diaristic ruminations. The eldest son in a family of eight children, Steffen studied art at the Illinois Institute of Technology in the late 1940s but his education was cut short by a mental breakdown which resulted in a fifteen year stay at the Elgin State hospital, where he underwent electroshock therapy for schizophrenia. It was there that he began to draw, but his prodigious early output was either lost or discarded. Upon his release, Steffen lived with his family and spent most of his time producing art.
