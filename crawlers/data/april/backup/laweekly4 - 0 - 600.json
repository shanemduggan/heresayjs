That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 1","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 1","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Nor would he likely countenance some of Talmadge’s revisionist tweaking. For example, the Supreme Deity, traditionally perceived as an angry male patriarch, has been halved into a Father God (J-Walt Adamczyk) and a Mother God (Marguerite French). And in the expulsion from Eden, it is Adam (Leslie Charles Roy, Jr.) rather than Eve (Alina Bolshkova) who first eats the forbidden fruit. On the other hand, Milton would probably have put his stamp of approval on the ensemble's depiction of ferocious battles between the forces of good and the forces of evil which, like its sensual elements, are brilliantly evoked in a fusion of dance, lighting, costumes, illuminating interactive video and acrobatics, to boot. The stunning videography has been imaginatively conceived by Adamczyk who, as Father God, opens the play using a hand-held computer device to spin abstract design images on the back wall. As we move into the story, the images colorize and expand to suggest the chaos of Creation, and still later segue into a lush verdant idyllic landscape, which is Eden, where the first two humans caper about like happy fawns. But we’re still in the creation stage when we’re introduced to the rapacious Satan (Talmadge), who wreaks his contempt on what God has wrought (streaks of red on the backdrop) and is then pitched out of Heaven into Hell, where he hooks up with Sin (a sizzling Laura Covelli) and Death (James Bane), a lumbering, bearish figure. Prior, Satan’s given a couple of chances to mend his ways, but perversely declines. Collectively choreographed, with leaps and bounds and startling suspensions from the ceiling, the subsequent encounters between Satan’s minions and God’s, led by the noble Archangel Michael (Anne-Marie Talmadge) are enacted with spectacular skill, with the performers utilizing not only their bodies to express emotion but, like any good speaking actor, their faces as well. The striking costumes (Ashphord Jacoway) and fluid lighting (John Bass) enhance the story further. It’s all most impressive. Although the spectacle is enough to warrant kudos, what marks the show as memorable is how Talmadge has re-interpreted the story to make it contemporary and relevant, and injected psychology into the mix. His Satan is a powerhouse of carnality and venom. Toward the end, there’s a prolonged sequence where Satan separates the passionately devoted Adam and Eve, then proceeds to indoctrinate the trustful Adam step-by-step into the ways of male dominance and wife abuse — until finally the paradise of the spirit he and Eve shared has been destroyed, and we are fast-forwarded to the present.","locationName":"Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-go-8057057","date":"April 1","type":"Theater","address":"544 N.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 1","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 1","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"Dawes","summary":"By Lily Moayeri Dawes have taken to the road, seemingly nonstop.

The eight-year evolution of Dawes, from twangy Americana to country-folk to jam band, is most smoothly experienced in the live version of these songs — but get comfortable at the historic Theatre at the Ace Hotel, as there will be only one intermission during the three-hour-long performance.

Their most recent phase finds them exploring a superbly brutish yet tuneful guitar/bass/drums minimalism that’s heard to sensational effect on the band’s new Silver/Lead set, out March 31 on their own Pinkflag label.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 2","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

Nor would he likely countenance some of Talmadge’s revisionist tweaking. For example, the Supreme Deity, traditionally perceived as an angry male patriarch, has been halved into a Father God (J-Walt Adamczyk) and a Mother God (Marguerite French). And in the expulsion from Eden, it is Adam (Leslie Charles Roy, Jr.) rather than Eve (Alina Bolshkova) who first eats the forbidden fruit. On the other hand, Milton would probably have put his stamp of approval on the ensemble's depiction of ferocious battles between the forces of good and the forces of evil which, like its sensual elements, are brilliantly evoked in a fusion of dance, lighting, costumes, illuminating interactive video and acrobatics, to boot. The stunning videography has been imaginatively conceived by Adamczyk who, as Father God, opens the play using a hand-held computer device to spin abstract design images on the back wall. As we move into the story, the images colorize and expand to suggest the chaos of Creation, and still later segue into a lush verdant idyllic landscape, which is Eden, where the first two humans caper about like happy fawns. But we’re still in the creation stage when we’re introduced to the rapacious Satan (Talmadge), who wreaks his contempt on what God has wrought (streaks of red on the backdrop) and is then pitched out of Heaven into Hell, where he hooks up with Sin (a sizzling Laura Covelli) and Death (James Bane), a lumbering, bearish figure. Prior, Satan’s given a couple of chances to mend his ways, but perversely declines. Collectively choreographed, with leaps and bounds and startling suspensions from the ceiling, the subsequent encounters between Satan’s minions and God’s, led by the noble Archangel Michael (Anne-Marie Talmadge) are enacted with spectacular skill, with the performers utilizing not only their bodies to express emotion but, like any good speaking actor, their faces as well. The striking costumes (Ashphord Jacoway) and fluid lighting (John Bass) enhance the story further. It’s all most impressive. Although the spectacle is enough to warrant kudos, what marks the show as memorable is how Talmadge has re-interpreted the story to make it contemporary and relevant, and injected psychology into the mix. His Satan is a powerhouse of carnality and venom. Toward the end, there’s a prolonged sequence where Satan separates the passionately devoted Adam and Eve, then proceeds to indoctrinate the trustful Adam step-by-step into the ways of male dominance and wife abuse — until finally the paradise of the spirit he and Eve shared has been destroyed, and we are fast-forwarded to the present.","locationName":"Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-go-8057057","date":"April 2","type":"Theater","address":"544 N.

There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"April 2","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date. The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"April 2","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 2","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"The Jon Hatamiya/Kyle Athayde Big Band","summary":"By John Payne Thus spake a famous symphony conductor: “Never look at the trombones, you’ll only encourage them.” He was unaware that in the jazz realm, the trombone adds both the moody mellifluousness and rude wildness that bring a real party to life.

The innovative vision adapted by NMA co-artistic director Jones (Welsh) Talmadge and co-directed with NMA co-artistic director Laura Covelli, blends dance, acrobatics, dynamic partnering and Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling in an original version of this iconic tale of Adam and Eve’s Temptation and the War in Heaven. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny opens at the Greenway Court Theatre on March 3 for a five-week run. Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny features bodies flying across the stage on harness and chains, augmented by the stunning and unique live digital animation effects of J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. While the performance ensemble battles as angels and demons, powerful visual images of the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden will be projected live on stage to weave an emotional tale surrounded by evocative original music and costumes. J-Walt, a performer, interactive designer, filmmaker, graphic artist, composer, and also a Scientific and Technical Academy Award winner for his development of a real-time pre-visualization system, has been at the forefront of interactive art and computer performance, expanding the uses of computer animation into unchartered territories – an innovative and exciting endeavor for this new NMA production. Not Man Apart’s retelling of humankind’s fall from grace includes a modern feminist approach to this timeless literary masterpiece - and proposes a timely conversation of gender equality, proactive communication, and the balance of power. Translating the eloquence of Milton into pure movement storytelling with no words; is only made possible by a stellar cast of angels and demons and a priceless design team featuring original music, costumes, and choreography, integrated with computer generated imagery. Whether you are familiar with the story of Paradise Lost, or not at all, and regardless of your belief system, Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny seeks a new perspective on the future of humanity, and to empower audiences to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole. It’s up to us, we get to create a Heaven on Earth. As Milton says: “The mind is its own place and in itself can make a Heaven of Hell, a Hell of Heaven.”","locationName":"Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/paradise-lost-reclaiming-destiny-7908975","date":"April 2","type":"Dance Theater","address":"544 N.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on.

That character, Carrie Ann (Laurie Okin), is a celebrated photographer whose latest exhibition features photos of dead chickens, which hints at something not quite right in her mind and spirit. Introduced at an arts seminar with great fanfare, she mounts the podium to deliver a quasi-incoherent speech that concludes with the words “We’re all going to die.” Although it's startling in the moment, the audience forgives her because, after all, she is an “artist.” Later we learn that the reason for her strange behavior may be the recent death of her dad (Frank Collison in flashback), also a photographer, who deeply influenced her life and work. Her photographs do seem to fascinate folks, and they propel Carrie Ann into a meaningful love affair with Jeffrey (Lea Coco); he’s a trends analyst (with an uncommonly ethical spine for someone in advertising) who serendipitously shows up at the event. The attraction is mutual, and the romance blossoms until Jeff’s diagnosis with pancreatic cancer upends their future plans. The play drags in the first half as it portrays the uncertainties of their developing relationship, typical of a dating situation. Carrie Ann’s history and her struggles to fight depression and remain creative come to us through her conversations with an arts professor (Susan Wilder) who’d once had an affair with Carrie’s father. Jeff’s a straight-shooter whose appealing qualities favorably compare with the crude lechery of his boss Terry (Jonathan Bray), who appears in scene after scene launching crass come-ons to women and blowing his mind with increasing amounts of cocaine. Things pick up in the second half when illness challenges the lovers to make some hard choices, and the drama coalesces around a concrete event, shedding some of the annoying ambivalences and half-baked digressions (into the nature of feminism, for one) that have gone before. It bears mention that the choices the characters make in this second half also seem contrived. Directed by Michael Peretzian, the performances are a mixed bag. Both Okin and Coco are genuine and likable in their roles, although their physical attraction often appears somewhat tenuous. Working from a strong center, Coco is on point from start to finish, but Okin is saddled with a backstory, having to do with a “complicated” relationship with her father, that comes off as more contrived than organic. It doesn’t help that the flashback scenes with her dad during his illness do not play persuasively, primarily because Collison's performance is over the top. As the lecherous Terry, Bray probably has the juiciest role, but his portrayal is adequate, not the scene-stealer it might be. Jennifer Sorenson delivers a smart and entertaining cameo as a not-to-be-snookered barmaid who gives Terry his comeuppance. Tania Verafield (as a talented photography student anxious to please Carrie Ann) and Alexandra Hellquist (in a variety of small roles) lend able support.","locationName":"Rogue Machine Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/still-life-8030096","date":"April 3","type":"Theater","address":"1089 N.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"April 3","type":"Art Museums","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411"},{"name":"La Brea Tar Pits","summary":"The world's most famous ice age excavation site also includes the adjoining Page Museum.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 3","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

A self-taught California minimalist born in 1898, McLaughlin started painting full-time only in 1946, after he’d served in both world wars. From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly. As part of as part of McLaughlin’s overdue exhibition at LACMA, the curators installed chairs — made specially by artist Roy McMakin — so you can stay and spend time with the work, as if they’re old friends with whom you need to catch up.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/john-mclaughlin-paintings-total-abstraction-7778495","date":"April 3","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles at Discovery Cube","summary":"After three decades of battling evil and exemplifying teamwork, the beloved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (TMNT) will appear in a museum exhibit for children and families to enjoy at Discovery Cube in Los Angeles.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 4","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

From a distance, his straight-edged geometric compositions look aloof and precise, but up close, they’re idiosyncratic, at least a little worn and a lot warmer than you’d expect. The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 4","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The resulting show presents a culture that is deeply connected to history yet constantly evolving and very much alive.","locationName":"Craft & Folk Art Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/focus-iran-2-contemporary-photography-and-video-7852914","date":"April 5","type":"Art Museums Arts & Culture","address":"5814 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-937-4230"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"April 5","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

They’re also startlingly prolific, having released four albums over the past three years, including their latest, the breezy, Nick Lowe–like Tea Surfing. Billy Bob, billed as “Bud Thornton,” plays drums and sings lead vocals in a pleasantly reedy croon, while J.D. Andrew provides the surf-y guitar and Teddy Andreadis plays organ.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 5","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

Developed by Los Angeles Conservancy, the tour guides visitors through one of the city's oldest neighborhoods with many layers of history and diverse communities. The influx of popular culinary hotspots and art galleries, combined with the area's rich history, makes Chinatown one of L.A.'s most exciting neighborhoods. The tour takes visitors to the Central Plaza in the heart of New Chinatown, and includes decades-old shops selling traditional teas, medicines, and Chinese imports; and places of historic importance in the battle for Chinese-American civil rights.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"April 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 6","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

SUPER VISION: The New German Abstraction is a contemporary survey of Heyne’s photo-based work (2004 – 2016), with an emphasis on his recent “SEAT” series of large format color abstractions. The show opens Saturday, February 25th, 2017 with a reception for the artist from 6 - 8 PM. Since the late 1970s, German photography abroad bears the influence and legacy of the “New Objectivity” of the Becher School (aka Dusseldorf School) and its well-known protagonists, such as Andreas Gursky, Candida Höfer, and Thomas Struth. Stefan Heyne’s “New German Abstraction” opposes this clarity and is emphatically non-representational. He has consistently pushed his photo-based images into radical abstraction and set aside visual clarity for the “indefinite”. In some early work, Heyne switched off the autofocus of a digital SLR camera (or deliberated used blur effects) to dissolve the shape and definition of his compositions. The result leaves the objects in his pictures in a state of uncertainty, resisting the usual observational parameters. Faint traces of things appear in the light, only to disappear again in the contiguous darkness. In his recent large-scale color series of “SEAT” works Heyne achieves a radical degree of abstraction through the use of high definition reproductions of perhaps one of the purest motifs of all: the cloudless sky. The color spectra of pure light that are revealed in these images seem blurry and ‘out of focus’, but they are not – instead, the viewer is confronted with an endless depth of space. His emphatic abstractions are in essence, rigorous in their ‘realism’. In her catalogue essay for Speak To Me (DKW), 2012, Curator Karen Irvine observed that, “Heyne is interested in making beautiful pictures that impart visual pleasure and spark the imagination. By frustrating our viewing process and our need to know what an image “is,” he forces our active participation in the work, and highlights the subjectivity of experience in the process. As he probes the boundaries of photography—how it is defined and what it can, and cannot, depict—he finds that there are none. In his deft hand, the camera becomes an instrument not of literal transcription, but poetic possibility.” Stefan Heyne (Germany, b. 1965) received his MA in stage design at the Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißenseehas, Berlin (1993). He began exhibiting photographs in 2004. Heyne has received four solo museum exhibitions in Germany. The Artist lives and works in Berlin.","locationName":"Diane Rosenstein Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/stefan-heyne-super-vision-the-new-german-abstraction-opening-7908081","date":"April 6","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Photography","address":"831 N.

The artist bought his painting supplies at Sears, which is among the reasons many of his works didn’t age too well. The white behind two sets of identical yellow, blue and black bars has yellowed slightly.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered.

As the salty, take-no-prisoners Southern patriarch, facing his own mortality and the disappointment engendered by an alcoholic son, Harry Groener delivers a gritty and gripping portrayal that compensates for the production’s weaknesses. His work is chiefly on display in the second act, where Big Daddy attempts to talk to his favorite son Brick (Ross Philips) who has been depressed and drinking heavily since the suicide of his best friend Skipper some time back. Brick is as disinclined to speak with his father as he is with his wife Maggie (Rebecca Mozo). (Note: the show is double cast.) The couple’s encounter, in Act 1, is mostly a diatribe by the bitter frustrated Maggie who’s been shut out by her husband, physically and otherwise. Maggie longs for Brick’s touch; she also acutely aware of her childlessness, of the importance of delivering a grandchild to Big Daddy to preserve her and Brick’s portion of their inheritance. And she’s begun to suspect the real reason for Brick’s dark recalcitrance and disaffection: his repressed physical longing, which he vehemently denies, for the now deceased Skip. And here's where we have a problem. Maggie isn't just smart; she's famously \"hot.\" But while Mozo does respectable work — strutting and strategizing around her bedroom, talking nonstop — the sizzle factor is missing. And that’s hardly surprising: As Brick, Philips is credible as a depressive and an alcoholic, but the magnetism and masculinity that compels both his wife and his father to want to be close to him regardless does not manifest. We never get a sense of what Brick had and what’s been lost before the triggering event left him an emotional invalid. Other problems exist with the blocking and the set (Steven Kemp), admittedly a terrific eye-catcher when you first enter the theater. With its broken molding, skewed windows and ripped up flooring, it’s a vivid on-point commentary on the lacerated lives of this family. But then the play begins, and you watch as the performers have to maneuver, constrained, on the cramped shortened dais, around the bulky furniture. The bar where Brick gets his alcohol is positioned (in the first act) so that it blocks the view of some of the audience. And a lot of Maggie’s speeches are delivered as she sits at her dresser, with her back to to us, face concealed. Still, Groener delivers enough mesmerizing moments in the second act to make up for for the limitations of the first, and to make us want to see the story through to the end. There are other strong performances: Dawn Didawick as a fluttery Big Mama, who’s lived 40 years in valiant denial of her husband’s disdain, and Patrick Wenk-Wolff as Brick’s elder brother Gooper, who bears his parents' rejection with steely resolve. Also, it’s a pleasure to again bask in the eloquent passages in Williams’ writing, and in that special decadence that belongs to him alone. If the shortcomings of this production can’t be overlooked, well, in this case, they surely can be forgiven.","locationName":"Antaeus Theatre Company","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/cat-on-a-hot-tin-roof-8080934","date":"April 7","type":"Theater","address":"110 E.

The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots.
