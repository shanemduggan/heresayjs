A haute-couture clothes buyer and general gofer to an insufferable A-list celebrity (shades of Sils Maria, though Assayas is on a very different thematic path), practicing medium Maureen is haunted, in all senses, by the recent death of her twin brother. Stalking his former abode at night seeking a final communication, she encounters a spirit or two—but whose? And are the insidious, anonymous texts that start invading her phone from another amorphous entity?\r\nAs Maureen's already fragile composure begins to fray, it's hard to tell if she's plagued more by absence or uncanny presence: Even her boss is barely visible to her, leaving a trail of curt notes and messages in her wake.

A haute-couture clothes buyer and general gofer to an insufferable A-list celebrity (shades of Sils Maria, though Assayas is on a very different thematic path), practicing medium Maureen is haunted, in all senses, by the recent death of her twin brother. Stalking his former abode at night seeking a final communication, she encounters a spirit or two—but whose? And are the insidious, anonymous texts that start invading her phone from another amorphous entity?\r\nAs Maureen's already fragile composure begins to fray, it's hard to tell if she's plagued more by absence or uncanny presence: Even her boss is barely visible to her, leaving a trail of curt notes and messages in her wake.

The former Twilight star was easily the standout feature of Assayas's last film, the slightly stilted study of actors Clouds of Sils Maria, quietly yanking the rug from under the feet of Juliette Binoche. Here, Stewart doesn't need to steal the film from anyone: She's in virtually every crisp frame of it, holding the camera's woozy gaze with her own quizzical, secretive stare and knotted body language.\r\nHer performance is a galvanizing human influence on the film, even as her character, introverted American-in-Paris Maureen, seems forever on the verge of voluntary evaporation. A haute-couture clothes buyer and general gofer to an insufferable A-list celebrity (shades of Sils Maria, though Assayas is on a very different thematic path), practicing medium Maureen is haunted, in all senses, by the recent death of her twin brother. Stalking his former abode at night seeking a final communication, she encounters a spirit or two—but whose? And are the insidious, anonymous texts that start invading her phone from another amorphous entity?\r\nAs Maureen's already fragile composure begins to fray, it's hard to tell if she's plagued more by absence or uncanny presence: Even her boss is barely visible to her, leaving a trail of curt notes and messages in her wake.

It’s 1973 and his character, a government-funded conspiracy nut, is talking about weather-shrouded Skull Island, deep in the South Pacific and only recently discovered by satellite. Soon, a detachment of tech nerds, soldiers, a brawny tracker (Tom Hiddleston) and an ambitious photojournalist (Room’s Brie Larson), will be dispatched there to either gather undiscovered plants or—as we all suspect—become monkey bait.\r\nDirected by Jordan Vogt-Roberts with a gleeful, look-at-me-ma garishness that speaks to his background in TV comedy, the movie feels wonderfully close to self-parody.

The former Twilight star was easily the standout feature of Assayas's last film, the slightly stilted study of actors Clouds of Sils Maria, quietly yanking the rug from under the feet of Juliette Binoche. Here, Stewart doesn't need to steal the film from anyone: She's in virtually every crisp frame of it, holding the camera's woozy gaze with her own quizzical, secretive stare and knotted body language.\r\nHer performance is a galvanizing human influence on the film, even as her character, introverted American-in-Paris Maureen, seems forever on the verge of voluntary evaporation. A haute-couture clothes buyer and general gofer to an insufferable A-list celebrity (shades of Sils Maria, though Assayas is on a very different thematic path), practicing medium Maureen is haunted, in all senses, by the recent death of her twin brother. Stalking his former abode at night seeking a final communication, she encounters a spirit or two—but whose? And are the insidious, anonymous texts that start invading her phone from another amorphous entity?\r\nAs Maureen's already fragile composure begins to fray, it's hard to tell if she's plagued more by absence or uncanny presence: Even her boss is barely visible to her, leaving a trail of curt notes and messages in her wake. Among the m","location":"","locationLink":"","date":""},{"name":"Kong: Skull Island","summary":"Overblown in almost every respect (not only its giant ape), Kong: Skull Island is the kind of Hollywood fever dream that, in its first few minutes alone, throws at you a WWII bomber crash, a sizzling montage of Cold War nuclear escalation and a wide-eyed John Goodman gushing about a “place where myth and science meet.” (He should be a screenwriter.) It’s 1973 and his character, a government-funded conspiracy nut, is talking about weather-shrouded Skull Island, deep in the South Pacific and only recently discovered by satellite. Soon, a detachment of tech nerds, soldiers, a brawny tracker (Tom Hiddleston) and an ambitious photojournalist (Room’s Brie Larson), will be dispatched there to either gather undiscovered plants or—as we all suspect—become monkey bait.\r\nDirected by Jordan Vogt-Roberts with a gleeful, look-at-me-ma garishness that speaks to his background in TV comedy, the movie feels wonderfully close to self-parody. When it’s a Vietnam War picture (which is often), we get every glorious cliché in the book, from slo-mo helicopters against a huge red sun to an endless stream of grungy rock nuggets by Creedence Clearwater Revival and other royalty magnets. And when the monsters do show up, somewhat anachronistically, it’s like we’re in the sandbox with the most imaginative 10-year-old: People get stomped, burning machinery gets flung for miles and giant spiders and vomiting lizards make up a parade of gooey spectacle. The effects work is always easy to follow; it’s a mov","location":"","locationLink":"","date":"Release date:  Friday March 10 2017"}]}
