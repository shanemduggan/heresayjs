[{"name":"The Road Warrior","summary":"By Nate Bell The Road Warrior (1981) initially was widely regarded as a leaner, louder, more muscular do-over of George Miller's Mad Max. Mel Gibson reprises his role as the rogue cop who finds himself defending, in the style of an old Western, a tight-knit community of post-nuclear desert dwellers against a pack of wheel-bound psychos. The New Beverly will pair it with the recent, universally lauded Mad Max: Fury Road. Miller's belated fourth entry in the series, sturdily supported by a kick-ass Charlize Theron, is a relentlessly exciting chase thriller that adds a potent feminist edge to this testosterone-fueled franchise.","locationName":"New Beverly Cinema","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-road-warrior-8279340","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"7165 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-938-4038"},{"name":"Julieta Venegas","summary":"By Falling James Julieta Venegas first came to attention when she was briefly a member of the subversive Mexican ska-punk band Tijuana No! in the early ’90s.

Venegas has never rocked as hard since then, eschewing politics and rebellion for a more nuanced and gently lulling pop approach on such albums as 2000’s Bueninvento and 2006’s Limón y Sal.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Actually — GO!","summary":"By Deborah Klugman In Anna Ziegler’s smart and penetrating play Actually, now premiering at the Geffen Playhouse, Tom (Jerry MacKinnon), a freshman at Princeton, recounts an incident in which his best buddy Sunil leans in and kisses him on the mouth. After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 2","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

Regis and Kathie Lee they are not, but what role do they play, exactly? They seem at least to be parodying on-screen consumerism and polish while acknowledging the sincerity of the desire for more, less or whatever.","locationName":"California African American Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/derrick-adams-network-8121979","date":"June 2","type":"Art Museums","address":"600 State Drive, Exposition Park Los Angeles, CA 90037 213-629-2787"},{"name":"Dwan Gallery Exhibition Image Los Angeles to New York:...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The largest crate that ever came into LACMA’s galleries held Robert Grosvenor's sculpture Untitled (yellow), or so said curator Stephanie Barron a few nights ago at a preview of \"Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971.\" Grosvenor’s sculpture, a futuristic abstraction in bright-yellow aluminum, hangs from the ceiling and juts across the space without ever touching the ground. Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 2","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Los Alamos Rolodex: Doing Business With the National Lab...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Edward Grothus used to work as a technician at the Los Alamos National Lab, which worked on the atomic bomb. But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 2","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art?

The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 2","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

The Swedish-born musician initially broke through as a teenage prodigy with early-’80s L.A. metal band Alcatrazz. Malmsteen’s guitar-hero status emerged with his Rising Force project in the years that followed. His neoclassical shred-guitar compositions took center stage and influenced a wave of musicians welding metallic loudness with over-the-top technicality, which continues to this day with modern acts such as L.A.’s own Exmortus. Malmsteen has at times become shorthand in metal circles for guitar excess, but when it’s as shamelessly bombastic as this, it’s all good.","locationName":"Saban Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/yngwie-malmsteen-7943081","date":"June 2","type":"Metal Rock","address":"8440 W.

Wang can take a quaintly traditional piece such as Mozart's \"Turkish March\" and infuse it with madcap bursts of jazz, barrelhouse piano and febrile allusions to other composers.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 3","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 3","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"It is obvious from the map","summary":"By Catherine Wagley One refugee had no trouble getting from Damascus to Turkey according to a hand-drawn map hanging in REDCAT’s current exhibition, “It is obvious from the map.” But police caused big problems on the trip from Turkey to Greece, and then different police forces beat the travelers as they tried to get from Macedonia to Serbia.

Is he propelled by his own volition or are there other, more sinister individuals or forces pulling the strings? Think of the training camps of ISIS or al-Qaida or portraits of suicide bombers, teenagers prepared to sacrifice their lives to destroy the lives of others, for a cause. Where do they come from and what brought them to this radical point? Loosely based on historical fact, Rajiv Joseph’s droll and penetrating Archduke takes place in Serbia in 1914, and opens in the months prior to the assassination of Austria-Hungary’s Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie — an act that precipitated World War I and changed the world forever. The spine of the play is the relationship between three of the youths recruited to carry out the murder (there actually were seven), and the fanatical military officer, Dragutin Dimitrijevic (Patrick Page), who indoctrinates them. While the details are fictional, the characters, including Dimitrijevic, are based on real personages: Gavrilo Princip (Stephen Stocking) who ultimately fired the fatal shots; Nedeljko Cabrinovic (Josiah Bania), who threw a bomb that missed; and a third co-conspirator and friend, Trifko Grabež (Ramiz Monsef) — in this telling of the story, the most together of the three. All three suffered from tuberculosis, and Joseph’s play begins in the examining room of a doctor (Todd Weeks) who tells Gavrilo that he’s ill and has less than a year to live. The sensitive and unworldly Gavrilo is slow to digest the news, and instead chooses to obsess over blood on the doctor’s handkerchief (his own), and the gender of the examining room skeleton (female), which offends his sensibilities as one respectful of the opposite sex. Later, the good doctor is visited by Colonel Dimitrijevic who requests that the physician send him five of his patients to be drafted into service. When the doctor refuses, he’s bullied and threatened with his life until he buckles and complies. There follows an entertaining scene among the three unsuspecting recruits — innocents, basically, who’ve never been with a woman and for whom a hot sandwich is as close to the good life as they hope to get. They’re prime fodder for Page’s incendiary Colonel, a crafty true believer who tempts them with promises of food and a free train ride, while singing the praises of martyrdom and handing each a vial of cyanide. Though broadly framed by historical events, Archduke easily transcends these particulars; its coruscating depiction of the manipulation of the unschooled by a predatory monomaniac is an unhappily timeless (not to mention excruciatingly relevant) phenomenon, and marks it as a play of considerable substance. Plus, Joseph’s characters are drawn with accomplished depth beyond their service to the plot. The production, however, while strong in many places, is weak in others. Under Giovanna Sardelli’s direction, Page proves electrifying as a ruthless (and misogynistic) zealot driven by crazed macho fantasies, while Monsef, who looks first to be the Colonel’s henchman but turns out to be just another gullible kid, is on point from first to last. Unfortunately, both Bania as the slow-witted Nedeljko and Stocking as the pivotal Gavrilo — a 19-year-old whose quest for meaning in his life ultimately rubs up against his will to survive — deliver serviceable performances only, and the show falls short of what it could be. Also, while Tim Mackabee’s scenic design unfolds cleverly in the second half, the action at the top plays out against a drab backdrop with the faces of the performers poorly lit in the design conceived by Lap Chi Chu. While it’s true these characters dwell in grim surroundings, they and the audience deserve more illumination.","locationName":"Mark Taper Forum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archduke-go-8221678","date":"June 4","type":"Theater","address":"135 N.

It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega.

Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence.

Simple and immediately legible despite halting English, they tell dramatic, sometimes violent stories in short hand. Co-curated by Thomas Keenan and Sohrab Mohebbi, the show uses maps to explore and trace recent and ongoing migration between the Middle East, Africa and Europe.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 4","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Roni Shneior: A Place in the Sun","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Roni Shneior’s sculpture Bloom is a tangle of ten arms with no body, only knots in the middle where they more or less meet.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"June 4","type":"Art Galleries","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722"},{"name":"Tomorrow!

The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C.

For a second time at UCB, Torres hosts Julio Torres: My Favorite Shapes. In it, Torres sits at a table and plays with knickknacks and other small-scale objects of various shapes: squares, triangles, spheres. Torres tells funny stories inspired by the shapes — some that remind him of celebrities, including Ivanka Trump, Tilda Swinton and Eddie Redmayne — while he projects the entire performance on a screen.

For seven minutes, clips keep coming: Michael Jackson dancing for a handheld camera in the back of an SUV, footage of riots, of basketball games, of Barack Obama singing \"Amazing Grace,\" of a crying toddler putting his hands against the wall because this is what police make men do. Kanye West’s gospel-inspired song \"Ultralight Beam\" serves as the soundtrack, though other voices often interrupt it. “I’m trying to keep my faith, but I’m looking for more,” West sings. “This is a god dream; This is everything.” Jafa’s video does embrace everything: rage, elation, pain, a legacy of oppression, gospel music, pop star royalty, presidential class, graphic police violence. All of these realities bleed together and coexist on the same intense, sensation-filled plane.","locationName":"Museum of Contemporary Art (The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA)","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/arthur-jafa-love-is-the-message-the-message-is-death-8097791","date":"June 5","type":"Art Galleries","address":"152 N. Central Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90012 213-626-6222"},{"name":"Archipelago","summary":"By Bill Raden Among the subtitles to Archipelago, Caridad Svich’s hauntingly enigmatic hallucination of a love story that is currently receiving its American premiere by Son of Semele Ensemble, are labels like “a memory play” and “a play on memory,” as well as “a dream of life.” These are all helpful to know before settling into a 2016 drama that is disorientingly stripped of the kind of reassuring external signposts that have accompanied romantic tragedy since Romeo and Juliet. It’s a vague and harrowingly tenuous place to spend 90 minutes. Rather than wasting words on the conventional whos, whats, wheres or whens of the genre, the bittersweet Archipelago unfolds almost entirely in the subjective blur of its two characters’ acts of remembering. Sarah Rosenberg and Michael Evans Lopez play star-crossed lovers whose existence is defined so exclusively in the ephemerality of the moment that concrete details are few. Even their names go unspoken until the final lines of the play. The couple’s episodic, two-decade relationship unfolds as a series of long separations interrupted by intense encounters that together form a topography of isolated and fleeting connection — islands of emotional continuity in a world increasingly disrupted by the violence and uncertainties of the political strife around them. Clues, however, suggest an American woman and a possibly Middle Eastern man who meet as carefree and careless 20-something travelers in a foreign, perhaps European city. There they are thoughtlessly parted, then fatefully thrown together nearly a lifetime later to pick up where they left off. But this time, they are in the man’s unnamed native city where the riptides of chance and revolution (Svich’s desert imagery and composer John Nobori’s exotic score suggest a conflict like the Arab Spring) converge to again sweep them apart before throwing them back together for the play’s oddly tentative yet hopeful conclusion. Rosenberg and Lopez do an expert job at rooting Svich’s clipped lyricism and densely poetic arias in the familiar raptures, fits of pique and rueful regrets that punctuate any love affair. And Lopez is all the more impressive for ably navigating the script’s most forbidding passages — the powerful monologues Svich has written in the disjointed poetry of the aphasia that his character suffers after being wounded in the play's political violence. Nevertheless, and in spite of the actors’ considerable heat, with language so narrowly focused on interior states of mind and an external world pushed so deeply into the background, the proceedings begin to feel coldly distanced and frustratingly disengaged. Designer Meg Cunningham’s set of benches and layered gauze curtains, which impressionistically diffract the imagery of Kat Pagsolingan’s ethereal projections, only emphasizes the play’s dreamlike dimensions. While that may be faithful to Svich’s intent, one soon begins to wish that director Barbara Kallir had countered the amorphousness of the play in a presentation more rigorously grounded in the physical than the single erotic “dance” sequence indifferently choreographed by Giovanni Ortega. In a production note, Svich recommends “a strong choreographic aesthetic,” and Kallir’s staging leaves one wistfully imagining how a bolder, dance-theater approach like that of director Tina Kronis might better complement Svich's airy lyricism.","locationName":"Son of Semele","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/archipelago-8288716","date":"June 5","type":"Theater","address":"3301 Beverly Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90004 213-351-3507"},{"name":"Dwan Gallery Exhibition Image Los Angeles to New York:...","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The largest crate that ever came into LACMA’s galleries held Robert Grosvenor's sculpture Untitled (yellow), or so said curator Stephanie Barron a few nights ago at a preview of \"Los Angeles to New York: Dwan Gallery, 1959-1971.\" Grosvenor’s sculpture, a futuristic abstraction in bright-yellow aluminum, hangs from the ceiling and juts across the space without ever touching the ground. Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"June 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 5","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 6","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

The intention of this evening is to bring together a diverse group of heart-centered women from all around LA for a night of inspired community. We are capping this event at 22 women to offer intimacy and an opportunity to genuinely connect with other women. This event includes a three course all-inclusive dinner, gifts {valued at over $200}, entertainment, and our iconic un-networking experience. GET YOUR TICKETS HERE: https://juneamplifydines.eventbrite.com/ NOTE: Amplify Dines tickets tend to sell out quickly. If you’re interested in joining, make sure purchase your tickets quickly! “Un-networking” is Amplify’s unique methodology that has been featured on KTLA, Forbes, and Medium where you are invited to build conversation and relationship based on who you are rather than what you do. This unusual approach has lead to hundreds of women building a lasting network of people they can rely on… instead of collecting a stack of business cards that goes neglected for months. Amplify has hosted over 30 sold out dinner parties in under two years, and in this time we have experienced first hand the level of impact that this event creates in the lives of every women who attended. Women walk away feel nourished both physically and emotionally, seen, heard, supported, inspired and confident in being supported by sisterhood.

Within ourselves and even within our own communities, I believe that we have the power to change the myths, preconceptions and inherited ideas surrounding sexual assault. We must educate ourselves and engage in thoughtful discourse, which this play so brilliantly concedes, in order to change the current culture” – Cathy Thomas-Grant; Director Set against the backdrop of the worldwide university campus sexual assault epidemic, THE INTERFERENCE follows one survivor’s struggle to make her story heard above all the noise. It explores the seemingly infinite outlets of opinion, commentary, and distorted or suppressed information that have become routine players in the aftermath of these incidents.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 6","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

The technical precision which is a hallmark of Mr. Chow's work, is even more apparent in these new works. \"I am thrilled to have the opportunity to launch this new series in Gallery 417,\" said Mr. Chow. \"The gallery, housed in the upscale Metro 417 building, provides the perfect environment to launch this series as it is both urban and modern in aesthetic. The clean lines of my work and the chic interior of the gallery complement each other well.\" The artist reception, where the entire body of work can be seen will be May 11 from 6-8 p.m. In addition to light refreshments, there will be an opportunity to meet the artist who will also be signing his limited edition books.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 6","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"TAG Gallery Reopening Show","summary":"This is TAG's first show at the new Museum Row location. \"TAG Gallery Reopening Show\" features Photography by Donn Delson, Bone Sculpture by Jerry Hardin, Mixed Media by Gary Polonsky, and Neon Sculptures by Linda Sue Price.

Feuerman Perception July 15 – August 20, 2016 Opening Reception: Thursday July 14, 7 – 9pm KM Fine Arts is pleased to announce a solo exhibition called “Perception” the first Los Angeles solo exhibition of New York based hyperrealist sculptor Carole A. Feuerman which will be on view from July 14 – August 20, 2016. Miniature, life-sized, and monumental works will be featured alongside a selection of daimon-dust coated silkscreens. Feuerman's iconic hyper-realistic swimmers and divers will be included in the exhibition and paired with new bronze works from her ballet dancer series. Carole A. Feuerman is recognized as one of the world’s most renowned, influential, and popular hyperrealist sculptors in the 1970’s with her photorealist paintings. Her prolific career spans four decades in which she has pioneered new approaches to sculpture. Working in both monumental and life size, and museum size, she is the only figurative artist to hyper-realistically paint bronze for outdoor public art, painting bronze to look like flesh, and the only sculptor to install these painted bronze sculptures in water. Carole Feuerman’s DurgaMa, inspired by the Hindu goddess Durga. The bronze figure sits in complete tranquility on a sacred lotus flower. She is the symbol of birth, rebirth and survival, which is a common theme present in much of Feuerman's work. The lotus flower can live for over a thousand years and along with Durga's universal powers, she can withstand all that the world throws her way. Feuerman's works explore classicism while presenting common themes that occur in our everyday lives. The sculptures tell powerful stories of experiences the artist has encountered in her own life that she feels compelled to tell. One can relate to them as we all struggle to overcome similar personal obstacles. Evoking inward emotions, Feuerman invites the spectator to identify with the narrative they see before them. Water and swimming have fascinated her all of her life as she has always been captivated by how the water droplets form patterns over the skin. Feuerman’s work continues her focus on public outdoor sculptures and table-top pieces. Feuerman maintains two studios in Chelsea NY and the other at Mana Contemporary in NJ. On an ongoing basis, Feuerman's work can be seen in selected galleries and museums worldwide.

After the unequivocally heterosexual Tom tells Sunil to back off, the two men never mention it again, and they resume their friendship as before. How different, observes Tom, from his experience with women, who are “incapable of moving on even if you make out once for five minutes on a fucking dance floor.” As portrayed by MacKinnon, Tom is an attractive guy who scores lots of casual sex but is otherwise not especially worldly or predatory. Instead, he’s a lower-middle-class African-American kid who plays classical piano and has painstakingly made his way into the Ivy League. But now his future is threatened; a female freshman, a Jewish coed named Amber (Samantha Ressler), has accused him of rape, and he’s been called upon to face a three-person panel who will determine how much truth her statement holds. If her word is taken over his, Tom’s future may be toast. To Tom, his predicament is bewildering; he’d been under the impression that Amber liked him and wanted to be intimate, moreover, he’d liked her as well, despite her awkward manner and sometimes tactless remarks, such as assuming he got into Princeton because he was black. In fact, to the audience observer, the hookup between these two young folks, despite its maladroitness, might even have the makings of a relationship, were circumstances different. Unfortunately for Tom, the current circumstances include his having misread this latest conquest, an insecure woman who confesses to us her apprehensions about sex in general, and reveals that her drinking and partying are less a natural predilection than a response to pressure from her more sophisticated friend Heather (who gifts Amber with her own personal flask). Moreover, her hours of practice on the university squash team in tandem with her bar activities preclude any time for study, another thing that makes her nervous and uncomfortable in these first months away from home. But one thing she knows for sure is that she’s attracted to Tom. And she feels very bad to see him “alone” and without support, answering the questions of the prying panel. This network of psychological nuance and the abundant detail Ziegler adds to her back story makes for a top-notch narrative that travels beyond the hot-button issue of date rape it tackles. The characters, Amber especially, are as finely etched as in a good novel, and as satisfying. Under Tyne Rafaeli’s direction, Ressler’s portrayal conjures a confused and maddeningly myopic young woman you alternately want to shake for her waffling ambivalence (she never actually says “no”) and comfort for her overwhelming anxiety. MacKinnon starts out a bit too much of a cypher but his performance visibly deepens as the web tightens around his character. Designer Tim Mackabee’s set resembles a textured wooden box that lighting designer Lap Chi Chu floods at certain junctures with varying hues of light. Pretty in places, I found it static, and wished for more lighting to be focused on the performers, when they rose from their seats, or when the story changed or shifted from past to present. By contrast, Vincent Olivieri sound design added notably to an uneasy ambience.","locationName":"Geffen Playhouse","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/actually-go-8265869","date":"June 7","type":"Theater","address":"10886 Le Conte Ave. Los Angeles, CA 90024 310-208-5454"},{"name":"Instructions to All Persons: Reflections On Executive...","summary":"By Siran Babayan The Japanese American National Museum marks the 75th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066 by President Franklin D.

A big, fake TV screen made of fabric squares and plastic hangs on the wall behind her. Several actors peddle cardboard boxes in On, pitching their products as if on a morning show or infomercial. They're enthusiastic if confusing. A girl-guy team peddles \"More for Less\" by saying it's just nice sometimes to have more, especially when it's for less. Sometimes, the camera zooms out, Brady Bunch–style, so you can see all the actors with their boxes at once, their perky voices overlapping. In On, which plays on a loop in Adams' show \"Network\" at the California African American Museum, all actors are black and their cultural position is ambiguous, because the set is so esoteric and their boxes all seem empty.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries","address":"3006 W.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill.

Within ourselves and even within our own communities, I believe that we have the power to change the myths, preconceptions and inherited ideas surrounding sexual assault. We must educate ourselves and engage in thoughtful discourse, which this play so brilliantly concedes, in order to change the current culture” – Cathy Thomas-Grant; Director Set against the backdrop of the worldwide university campus sexual assault epidemic, THE INTERFERENCE follows one survivor’s struggle to make her story heard above all the noise.

Yang’s meticulously weaved “trashion” pieces, as well as his mesmerizing light sculptures, all made from recycled materials, will be on display from April 21 to June 16 at Taiwan Academy’s gallery located in the Westwood Village. The opening reception on April 21 will be by RSVP only. Aside from exhibiting a total of eight installations accompanied by a video reel that documents his works, Yang is also scheduled to present his interactive performance piece titled “The Trash Man” in the Earth Day LA 2017 event on April 19, hosted at Grand Park by LADWP, and at Polliwog Park on April 22, hosted by the City of Manhattan Beach. Based in New York, Yang is a multidisciplinary artist who has received international attention and critical acclaim for his dedication to environmental activism through provocative artistic practices. Through combining found materials and using his own body, Yang often makes art in bustling urban spaces, to intervene the flow of urban life in a guerilla manner and voices his protests against the negative environmental impact caused by modern consumerism. The exhibition is divided into two related groups of works; Rejuvenated Fashion, featuring a series of alternative fashion pieces weaved from discarded aluminum cans, and Light of Life, a series of light installations constructed from a variety of disposed materials. Yang transforms excess waste into drastically new forms; by combining them with other salvaged parts such as wires and electronics, he creates not only installations with distinct textures and meanings, but wearable pieces he utilizes for his other disciplines. In his interactive performances, Yang often employs bizarre body language and outlandish physical presence to convey humor and irony, to wittily dissipate the fog of preconceptions that hinders the individual. With his unusual approach, Yang paves an unique path that allows him to address contemporary cultural phenomena related to topics such as pollution, isolation and intolerance, and formulate aesthetically striking responses to the anxiety and entrancement he sees the modern world suffering from. Yang deeply values opportunities to share his art with people who do not ordinarily encounter art. From his own unique life experiences, Yang believes that art should exist in the lives of the general public, therefore most of his works involve great effort in interacting and engaging with the public.","locationName":"Taiwan Academy in Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/rejuvenate-x-illuminate-recycled-art-and-trashion-by-chin-chih-yang-8109039","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture Environmental","address":"1137 Westwood Blvd Los Angeles, California 90024 213-403-0168"},{"name":"Christopher Orr: The Inmost Light","summary":"Certain paintings in Christopher Orr’s show at Ibid., \"The Inmost Light,\" recall scenes from HBO’s The Leftovers.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"June 7","type":"Art Museums","address":"399 N.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"June 7","type":"Art Galleries","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Like Persian miniatures, Bustamante’s paintings are elaborate and enticing. Flowers from Mars combines carefully painted human-interpreted flora with otherworldly environments. The environments are constructed with washes of gouache and acrylic paint to create ethereal and atmospheric settings, where microscopic gardens float and flourish. Laurel finds abstraction to be more poetic in expressing nature than realism. Researching botanical motifs found in history is an important part of her process. By combining and contrasting highly rendered flora within atmospheric and abstract settings, she is exploring the schism in the human brain between our delight in nature and our global inability to maintain it. Each painting develops organically without a predetermined plan. The contrast between vaporous washes and tiny brushwork is extreme and requires a slow, contemplative process. Laurel Bustamante received her Bachelor of Fine Arts from Southern Oregon University, Summa Cum Laude. In 2013, she was the finalist for the Portland Art Museum Contemporary Northwest Art Awards, in Portland Oregon.
