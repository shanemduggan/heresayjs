[{"name":"Eastside Mural Ride","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart L.A.'s Latino heritage is richly represented in murals on walls throughout the city, but particularly in East L.A. and other neighborhoods east of downtown. (No, Silver Lake isn't the Eastside, dudes.) To celebrate that tradition and to encourage transportation policy that encourages bike- and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, Multicultural Communities for Mobility and L.A. Metro are hosting the Eastside Mural Ride, a roughly 10-mile bike ride through East L.A. and City Terrace. Besides mural appreciation, riders will learn about bike safety and riding in traffic with insufficient bike infrastructure, and bike mechanics will be on hand in case of any blowouts or other mishaps. There's no better way to see the city.","locationName":"East L.A.

Alvarez’s tragicomic riff on Russian melancholy, is that it is not Chekhov by another name. True, Alvarez’s going-to-seed, middle-aged app designer Nicky (Cyrus Wilcox) does sport the diminutive and even much of the demeanor of Nikolai Ivanov, the brooding, Hamlet-like hero of Chekhov’s first full-length drama, Ivanov. And Alvarez’s story boasts generically similar situations and even lifts much of the dramatis personae from the father of Russian drama. Nevertheless, as the disclaimer goes, any resemblance to what is usually meant by the word “Chekhovian” in Coeurage Theatre Company’s world-premiere offering at Greenway Court Theatre is entirely coincidental. That’s because rather than an adaptation, which might be expected to blow the dust off a canonical classic for a modern audience, Alvarez has simply lifted the familiar shell of Ivanov and dropped it onto the very different chassis of what plays as a 1980s closet melodrama. Act 1 opens on Benoît Guérin’s midcentury-modern living room set as Nicky sunbathes at his Palm Springs swimming pool. It turns out that the pool is as far as he can get from his devoted Filipina wife Anna (Sandy Velasco) without actually physically leaving the house. Even the sound of her warbling the treacly Debby Boone ballad, \"You Light Up My Life,\" on her home karaoke machine elicits his physical revulsion. At first Nicky’s avoidance seems to be denial over what is soon revealed as Anna’s advanced cancer. Or maybe he is merely depressed over his imminent bankruptcy and hiding from his main creditor, Zina (Emily Swallow), the miserly, loan shark wife of his best friend Pavel (Daniel Kaemon). It is only when Nicky attends the 21st birthday party for Sasha (Chris Aguila), Pavel and Zina’s gay son, that the secret torch Nicky and Sasha have been hiding finally flares into view. The consequences of that public revelation play out in Act 2 as Anna’s crushing disillusionment, Pavel’s sense of angry betrayal and Nicky’s emotional seesawing between acceptance, guilt and self-loathing. The accepted view of Chekhov is that by successfully blending the tragic and the comic and by locating emotion between the lines rather than on top of them, he gave the world the modern drama of psychological discovery. But in Beth Lopes’ sometimes unfocussed staging (strained by a surfeit of interstitial furniture moving), emotions are pinned onto the ensemble’s sleeves and the laughs feel little more than nervous comic relief. Jaime Barcelon, Taylor Hawthorne and Mark Jacobson make a welcome appearance as a trio of Sasha’s wisecracking gay demimonde friends, and the always intense Jeremy Lelliott injects antic energy as the tippler Misha, but too much of the vestigial Chekhovian bric-a-brac only gets in the way. The play’s depiction of Nicky and his circle (Ted Barton, Alexis Genya, Julia Silverman) as some sort of Russian high-tech diaspora in the California desert particularly seems like a stretch. Still, Nicky has enough hints at the more personally compelling story that one suspects Alvarez wanted to tell — Michelle Stann’s suggestively camp sound design; Velasco’s poignant portrait of immigrant longing — that one wishes he’d have merely jettisoned Anton and made it an all-Boni show.","locationName":"Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/nicky-8311621","date":"July 1","type":"Theater","filterType":"Theater","address":"544 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Swedish occult rockers Ghost will add to the metal celebration with the catchy Satanic sing-alongs, such as “Square Hammer,” that have made them a fan favorite in recent years.","locationName":"Glen Helen Amphitheater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/iron-maiden-8357451","date":"July 1","type":"Metal Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"2575 Glen Helen Parkway San Bernardino, CA 92407 909-880-6500","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/glen-helen-amphitheater-5508639"},{"name":"Agent Orange, JFA, Harbortown Saints","summary":"By Sam Ribakoff Despite the encroaching luxury condos, Long Beach is still very much a working-class city, musically defined as much by the G-Funk hip-hop of the ’90s as by the hardcore, skate punk and ska scenes that have been an off-and-on presence in the city since the early ’80s. That makes the slightly seedy Alex’s Bar in Long Beach a perfect venue, in a perfect city, to see the ’80s surf-punk pioneers Agent Orange and the skate-punk trailblazers JFA. Although both bands are getting up there in age, they still play with an impassioned snarl that can match any 18-year-old punk’s energy. Both bands should bring in a typically diverse mix of Long Beach punks of all races and orientations.","locationName":"Alex's Bar","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/agent-orange-jfa-harbortown-saints-8304289","date":"July 1","type":"Punk Rock Surf","filterType":"Music","address":"2913 E.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"July 2","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum. It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"July 2","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"July 2","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"July 2","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

Our story unfolds at a fishing lodge in rural Georgia often visited by \"Froggy\" LeSeuer, a British demolition expert who occasionally runs training sessions at a nearby army base. This time Froggy has brought along a pathologically shy young man named Charlie who is overcome with fear at the thought of making conversation with strangers. So Froggy tells everyone that Charlie is from an exotic foreign country and speaks no English. The fun begins when Charlie overhears more than he should — hilarious and damaging revelations made with the belief that Charlie doesn't understand a word of English. The fact that only Charlie and the audience are in on the joke fuels the nonstop hilarity of the play and sets up the wildly funny climax in which things go uproariously awry for the \"bad guys,\" and the \"good guys\" emerge triumphant.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer.

Artist / Illustrator / Animator York's work is uncanny and surreal - filled with emotion and always tinted with wonderfully offbeat humor. York has been exhibiting his work at top galleries in Tokyo, Seattle and Los Angeles.

Zappa's work is primarily knitted or crocheted. She does not plan her work, preferring to work in an incredibly spontaneous and unexpected manner.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"July 4","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

Through their respective evocations, elisions, and departures from representation, the works in this exhibition resonate with a shared concern for the vulnerable and contingent conditions of being. Some works in the exhibition draw from discreet archives imbued with a sense of intimacy, while others are invested in the paradoxically delicate and destructive potential of the human body and subsequent structures of relation.

The exhibition \"Night Skies\" continues the artist’s explorations with graphite on Bristol while expanding density of detail, complexity of pattern structures, and commitment to challenging content. Before the Flood, Noah retrieved Adam’s body, the body of the first Man, and stowed it on the Ark. After the Flood, Noah’s son Shem saw the sign that God had foretold Noah and followed it to the center of Creation. There Shem buried the Body of Adam and established Jerusalem. Origin myths such as this have the power to transform a landscape by imbuing it with the awe and wonder of fantastical stories. These myths enshrine and transmit important cultural beliefs but the transformation of a place through story can also unfold within the idiosyncrasies of curiosity. Beltz has found this to be true through his fifteen-year interest in roadside ethno botany. The hidden human history connected to a plant, once discovered, can change an anonymous weed into a potent signifier sending the imagination across oceans. At the center of the Artist’s Creation is the tree stump. Without a canopy, the landscape fills with weeds; in this case, the Holy Flower of the North Star, Datura. It is poison, medicine, hallucinogen, bio-remediator, and common roadside plant. This field of weeds is where the Body of Adam will be buried again. Anchored only by his toes, frozen in transcendence, hovering over this low shrub, Adam’s body fades into the flora and becomes the starry night in a glowing explosion. Form dissolves into pattern into a constellated heaven. The unfixed, ponderous Picture Frame then wanders up through the branches of shadowy trees and drifts away, following shifting aspects of the moon and stars, looking for Land. For the past decade Eric Beltz has devoted himself to a simple and focused choice: graphite on Bristol. His drawings are intensely detailed with form, text, pattern, and a stunningly rich grayscale that transcends the limits of the media. Working as a visual essayist and poet, Beltz explores and combines a range of topics: origin myths, American history, ethno botany, ancient religions, and taboo symbolism. He balances the narrow path of pencil on paper with a broad channel cut by his far-reaching interests, seeking discoveries in uncommon mixtures of rare knowledge. Eric Beltz has been in many solo and group shows across the U.S. His work has been featured in Juxtapoz, Art In America, LA Times, NY Times, and American Artist among others. His work is in the permanent collections of the Nerman Museum (KS), Progressive Collection (OH), Santa Barbara Museum of Art (CA), Art, Design, and Architecture Museum (CA), and as a promised gift to the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY). Eric Beltz lives and works in Santa Barbara, CA where he teaches drawing at UCSB.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/eric-beltz-night-skies-8272259","date":"July 4","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"1923 S.

The exhibition titled \"Head\" defines the images in terms of seriality, this new collection of works on paper show how the variant image of a head, can be cross pollinated in one medium and eventually fed into another. Craig Taylor continues to investigate motifs in the shape of a head. Built out of layered systems of mark making, the abstract lines are saliently grafted onto the head-like form so as to capture the transformation of pictorial order. The exhibition consists of 6 paintings on paper and 6 intaglio mono-prints. Evident in the work is the fluidity of a back and forth between mediums. At times the images are nearly descriptive in terms of illusionism but they quickly traverse back to flatness. Lines, globules, dashes, and streaks occupy the figure as if it’s defaced with a mischievous eccentric writing. Pulsating lines operate like a congealed EEG test across the entirety of the form. As a process, the marks fill up the space while they also describe the space they are filling. In the paintings on paper, the space can have an immediacy that is monumentally intimate. Discordant colors embody the \"HEAD (variant)\"–country club green, bright red, deep luminous yellow, and peacock blue, sit in relation to shades of muted green. The marks are fluid and blobby but the \"HEAD (variant)\" creates an original within the possible fixed matrix. Color and line converge to create the inside and outside at the same time. The form can be at once your existential-self or maybe something as uncanny as a monstrous topiary blooming before the eyes. This work is in a constant battle between verb and noun. Predicated on the hope of creating an experience that is unique to two-dimensional space. The intaglio mono-prints are a result of Craig Taylor’s third collaboration with Jennifer Melby Editions, Brooklyn, NY. Craig Taylor received his BFA from Maine College of Art and his MFA from Yale University. In addition to his previous CB1 Gallery exhibition, he has had solo shows at Sue Scott Gallery and March Gallery in New York, La Montagne in Boston, and Test: Showroom, Berlin. Taylor has been included in numerous group exhibitions at various galleries among them CTRL Gallery, Houston, Texas; 106 Greene, Brooklyn, New York; Bakalar and Paine Galleries, Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, and Fred [London], Leipzig. Taylor is an Assistant Professor of painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and has previously taught at Massachusetts College of Art, Pratt, Brandeis University, and Yale University.

Cranston says, “I was influenced by Van Gogh who frequently would paint the same composition twice in what seemed to be different colors. The hues (the colors of paint) were actually the same only mixed at different ratios. Of course, Monet did the same to achieve different light effects. I have done several works over the years using similar ideas. I am interested in how things look or seem different but be structurally identical.” The new paintings fuse, in Cranston’s idiosyncratic way, her ongoing interest in color theory and how it functions within consumer culture vis-a-vis corporate marketing and branding strategies, as well as its relationship to personal and collective experience, with the aesthetics and history of high Modernist abstraction. Using a palette of the same four colors, Cranston reworks an abstract painting by one of the key figures in Modernism, Swiss / French artist, architect and designer Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965) in six variations, identical in form and composition but in different color combinations. The colors are related to Pantone’s “Color of the Year” designated each year by the New Jersey-based color systems and technology company, found in all manner of consumer products from home décor to fashion, which Cranston has investigated in various ways in several prior exhibitions. Each painting has a shorthand title of a year, for instance, “‘93”, denoting the artist’s personal, intuitive vision of the characteristic colors of that year in history, precise or not. A small acrylic on paper study for the six works, three of which are included in the show, acts as a key to the paintings, each year in the painting’s title significant to the artist in some meaningful way. The lyrical abstraction of these paintings is contrasted with smaller geometric abstract paintings, rigid in structure and form, but handmade, with deliberately imperfect and variably weighted lines, in an ironic and humorous way.","locationName":"Meliksetian | Briggs","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/meg-cranston-same-composition-different-hues-different-titles-8361533","date":"July 4","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"313 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"July 4","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"399 N.

Some works in the exhibition draw from discreet archives imbued with a sense of intimacy, while others are invested in the paradoxically delicate and destructive potential of the human body and subsequent structures of relation.

The exhibition \"Night Skies\" continues the artist’s explorations with graphite on Bristol while expanding density of detail, complexity of pattern structures, and commitment to challenging content. Before the Flood, Noah retrieved Adam’s body, the body of the first Man, and stowed it on the Ark. After the Flood, Noah’s son Shem saw the sign that God had foretold Noah and followed it to the center of Creation. There Shem buried the Body of Adam and established Jerusalem. Origin myths such as this have the power to transform a landscape by imbuing it with the awe and wonder of fantastical stories. These myths enshrine and transmit important cultural beliefs but the transformation of a place through story can also unfold within the idiosyncrasies of curiosity. Beltz has found this to be true through his fifteen-year interest in roadside ethno botany. The hidden human history connected to a plant, once discovered, can change an anonymous weed into a potent signifier sending the imagination across oceans. At the center of the Artist’s Creation is the tree stump. Without a canopy, the landscape fills with weeds; in this case, the Holy Flower of the North Star, Datura. It is poison, medicine, hallucinogen, bio-remediator, and common roadside plant. This field of weeds is where the Body of Adam will be buried again. Anchored only by his toes, frozen in transcendence, hovering over this low shrub, Adam’s body fades into the flora and becomes the starry night in a glowing explosion. Form dissolves into pattern into a constellated heaven. The unfixed, ponderous Picture Frame then wanders up through the branches of shadowy trees and drifts away, following shifting aspects of the moon and stars, looking for Land. For the past decade Eric Beltz has devoted himself to a simple and focused choice: graphite on Bristol. His drawings are intensely detailed with form, text, pattern, and a stunningly rich grayscale that transcends the limits of the media. Working as a visual essayist and poet, Beltz explores and combines a range of topics: origin myths, American history, ethno botany, ancient religions, and taboo symbolism. He balances the narrow path of pencil on paper with a broad channel cut by his far-reaching interests, seeking discoveries in uncommon mixtures of rare knowledge. Eric Beltz has been in many solo and group shows across the U.S. His work has been featured in Juxtapoz, Art In America, LA Times, NY Times, and American Artist among others. His work is in the permanent collections of the Nerman Museum (KS), Progressive Collection (OH), Santa Barbara Museum of Art (CA), Art, Design, and Architecture Museum (CA), and as a promised gift to the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY). Eric Beltz lives and works in Santa Barbara, CA where he teaches drawing at UCSB.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/eric-beltz-night-skies-8272259","date":"July 5","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"1923 S.

Throughout her often troubled life Zemánková cultivated a unique personal botany in crayon, ink and oil pastel, creating her own singular realm of emotionally-charged lyrical abstraction. Zemánková was born in Moravia (today part of the Czech Republic) in 1908. She worked as a dental technician before marrying a military officer and subsequently dedicated herself to raising four children, one of whom, her first-born son, died in infancy - a tragedy that Zemánková never completely recovered from. It wasn’t until Zemánková was in her early fifties that she started drawing. One of her sons, a sculptor, provided her with materials and encouraged her to produce art as an antidote for the persistent melancholy that afflicted her. During the pre-dawn hours, while the rest of the world slept, Zemánková listened to classical music and drew anomalous biomorphic forms that quivered and pulsated with a life of their own; stamens that rippled like electrical currents; tendrils that twined, spiraled and unfolded into otherworldly blossoms. These subtle and delicately-hewn drawings exude a powerful presence. In the absence of gallery shows, Zemánková held “open house” exhibitions every few years, and her work came to the attention of Jean Dubuffet who included several of her pieces in the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne, the world’s most notable collection of Outsider Art. Although her subject matter remained much the same, a number of different phases - marked by her adoption of new mediums, including collage, embroidery, and bead-work - define Zemánková’s artistic career. She was a restless, questing spirit who kept working even after both of her legs were amputated due to severe diabetes. In 1979, Zemánková achieved significant recognition when she was featured alongside Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez and others in the groundbreaking group show at London’s Hayward Gallery that was the first major exhibition to give art world exposure to self-taught visionary artists. More recently, eighteen of Zemánková’s works were included in the seminal 2013 Venice Benniale, organized by Masimilliano Gioni, director of New Museum, NY—the first time in the venerable contemporary art exhibition’s 118 year history that the work of Outsider artists was represented. Thirty years after her death, interest in Zemánková has never been greater. Shows of her work will be up this summer at the Collection de l’Art Brut Lausanne and the Cavin-Morris Gallery in New York, while at The Good Luck Gallery in Los Angeles we are delighted to be presenting the first ever solo exhibit of Zemánková’s art in California, where her rarely-seen beaded and embroidered works will be shown, as well as many collages and drawings.","locationName":"The Good Luck Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/anna-zem-nkov-8107584","date":"July 5","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"945 Chung King Rd.

The exhibition titled \"Head\" defines the images in terms of seriality, this new collection of works on paper show how the variant image of a head, can be cross pollinated in one medium and eventually fed into another. Craig Taylor continues to investigate motifs in the shape of a head. Built out of layered systems of mark making, the abstract lines are saliently grafted onto the head-like form so as to capture the transformation of pictorial order. The exhibition consists of 6 paintings on paper and 6 intaglio mono-prints. Evident in the work is the fluidity of a back and forth between mediums. At times the images are nearly descriptive in terms of illusionism but they quickly traverse back to flatness. Lines, globules, dashes, and streaks occupy the figure as if it’s defaced with a mischievous eccentric writing. Pulsating lines operate like a congealed EEG test across the entirety of the form. As a process, the marks fill up the space while they also describe the space they are filling. In the paintings on paper, the space can have an immediacy that is monumentally intimate. Discordant colors embody the \"HEAD (variant)\"–country club green, bright red, deep luminous yellow, and peacock blue, sit in relation to shades of muted green. The marks are fluid and blobby but the \"HEAD (variant)\" creates an original within the possible fixed matrix. Color and line converge to create the inside and outside at the same time. The form can be at once your existential-self or maybe something as uncanny as a monstrous topiary blooming before the eyes. This work is in a constant battle between verb and noun. Predicated on the hope of creating an experience that is unique to two-dimensional space. The intaglio mono-prints are a result of Craig Taylor’s third collaboration with Jennifer Melby Editions, Brooklyn, NY. Craig Taylor received his BFA from Maine College of Art and his MFA from Yale University. In addition to his previous CB1 Gallery exhibition, he has had solo shows at Sue Scott Gallery and March Gallery in New York, La Montagne in Boston, and Test: Showroom, Berlin. Taylor has been included in numerous group exhibitions at various galleries among them CTRL Gallery, Houston, Texas; 106 Greene, Brooklyn, New York; Bakalar and Paine Galleries, Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, and Fred [London], Leipzig. Taylor is an Assistant Professor of painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and has previously taught at Massachusetts College of Art, Pratt, Brandeis University, and Yale University.

Cranston says, “I was influenced by Van Gogh who frequently would paint the same composition twice in what seemed to be different colors. The hues (the colors of paint) were actually the same only mixed at different ratios. Of course, Monet did the same to achieve different light effects. I have done several works over the years using similar ideas. I am interested in how things look or seem different but be structurally identical.” The new paintings fuse, in Cranston’s idiosyncratic way, her ongoing interest in color theory and how it functions within consumer culture vis-a-vis corporate marketing and branding strategies, as well as its relationship to personal and collective experience, with the aesthetics and history of high Modernist abstraction. Using a palette of the same four colors, Cranston reworks an abstract painting by one of the key figures in Modernism, Swiss / French artist, architect and designer Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965) in six variations, identical in form and composition but in different color combinations. The colors are related to Pantone’s “Color of the Year” designated each year by the New Jersey-based color systems and technology company, found in all manner of consumer products from home décor to fashion, which Cranston has investigated in various ways in several prior exhibitions. Each painting has a shorthand title of a year, for instance, “‘93”, denoting the artist’s personal, intuitive vision of the characteristic colors of that year in history, precise or not. A small acrylic on paper study for the six works, three of which are included in the show, acts as a key to the paintings, each year in the painting’s title significant to the artist in some meaningful way. The lyrical abstraction of these paintings is contrasted with smaller geometric abstract paintings, rigid in structure and form, but handmade, with deliberately imperfect and variably weighted lines, in an ironic and humorous way.","locationName":"Meliksetian | Briggs","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/meg-cranston-same-composition-different-hues-different-titles-8361533","date":"July 5","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"313 N.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"July 5","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"399 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

But by ’97, that flirtation with stardom was left to rot, and the Melvins crawled back into the primordial metal ooze where they truly belong. The remarkably prolific trio, which now also features bassist Steven McDonald, just released a new double album, A Walk With Love and Death, this year, so expect plenty of new songs.

On debut album Feel Your Feelings Fool!, they tackle issues such as body image and relationships with rock & roll rhythm and a sense of empowerment. More recently, in their video for “Seashore,” the L.A.-based band move from a presidential stage to a witch burning to a suffragette protest, exasperated at the never-ending history of sexism. If there’s a band ready to lead the new generation of punk-influenced feminists, it’s The Regrettes. Fellow locals The Tracks have been making a splash even without much music available online. Most recently, they unleashed two live tracks recorded for Amazon series I Love Dick, including a stunning cover of the Don Gibson song “Oh Lonesome Me.”","locationName":"Levitt Pavilion at MacArthur Park","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-regrettes-8302871","date":"July 6","type":"Alternative Garage Rock Pop Punk Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"2230 W.

The legendary pedal steel guitarist, who replaced Tom Brumley in Buck Owens’ Buckaroos circa ’69, is an incomparable musician with impeccable taste and an impressive trove of stellar credits. Maness’ warm, expressive style — always complementary, never overplayed — made him an in-demand sideman, and he has recorded with everyone from Gram Parsons and The Byrds to Charlie Rich and Waylon Jennings. Joined at this weekly sit-down jam by the likes of formidable guitar slingers Carmine Sardo and Cody Bryant, pianist Skip Edwards and local hero Ronnie Mack, Maness is in the ideal setting, and the results are invariably stunning.","locationName":"Cody's Viva Cantina","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/jay-dee-maness-cody-bryant-skip-edwards-ronnie-mack-6741578","date":"July 6","type":"Country Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"900 Riverside Dr. Burbank, CA 91506 818-848-8810","price":"free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/codys-viva-cantina-2183790"},{"name":"Marty & Elayne","summary":"","locationName":"The Dresden Restaurant","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/marty-and-elayne-4290756","date":"July 6","type":"Music Jazz Lounge Pop","filterType":"Music","address":"1760 N.

Cranston says, “I was influenced by Van Gogh who frequently would paint the same composition twice in what seemed to be different colors. The hues (the colors of paint) were actually the same only mixed at different ratios. Of course, Monet did the same to achieve different light effects. I have done several works over the years using similar ideas. I am interested in how things look or seem different but be structurally identical.” The new paintings fuse, in Cranston’s idiosyncratic way, her ongoing interest in color theory and how it functions within consumer culture vis-a-vis corporate marketing and branding strategies, as well as its relationship to personal and collective experience, with the aesthetics and history of high Modernist abstraction. Using a palette of the same four colors, Cranston reworks an abstract painting by one of the key figures in Modernism, Swiss / French artist, architect and designer Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965) in six variations, identical in form and composition but in different color combinations. The colors are related to Pantone’s “Color of the Year” designated each year by the New Jersey-based color systems and technology company, found in all manner of consumer products from home décor to fashion, which Cranston has investigated in various ways in several prior exhibitions. Each painting has a shorthand title of a year, for instance, “‘93”, denoting the artist’s personal, intuitive vision of the characteristic colors of that year in history, precise or not. A small acrylic on paper study for the six works, three of which are included in the show, acts as a key to the paintings, each year in the painting’s title significant to the artist in some meaningful way. The lyrical abstraction of these paintings is contrasted with smaller geometric abstract paintings, rigid in structure and form, but handmade, with deliberately imperfect and variably weighted lines, in an ironic and humorous way.","locationName":"Meliksetian | Briggs","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/meg-cranston-same-composition-different-hues-different-titles-8361533","date":"July 6","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"313 N.

The exhibition titled \"Head\" defines the images in terms of seriality, this new collection of works on paper show how the variant image of a head, can be cross pollinated in one medium and eventually fed into another. Craig Taylor continues to investigate motifs in the shape of a head. Built out of layered systems of mark making, the abstract lines are saliently grafted onto the head-like form so as to capture the transformation of pictorial order. The exhibition consists of 6 paintings on paper and 6 intaglio mono-prints. Evident in the work is the fluidity of a back and forth between mediums. At times the images are nearly descriptive in terms of illusionism but they quickly traverse back to flatness. Lines, globules, dashes, and streaks occupy the figure as if it’s defaced with a mischievous eccentric writing. Pulsating lines operate like a congealed EEG test across the entirety of the form. As a process, the marks fill up the space while they also describe the space they are filling. In the paintings on paper, the space can have an immediacy that is monumentally intimate. Discordant colors embody the \"HEAD (variant)\"–country club green, bright red, deep luminous yellow, and peacock blue, sit in relation to shades of muted green. The marks are fluid and blobby but the \"HEAD (variant)\" creates an original within the possible fixed matrix. Color and line converge to create the inside and outside at the same time. The form can be at once your existential-self or maybe something as uncanny as a monstrous topiary blooming before the eyes. This work is in a constant battle between verb and noun. Predicated on the hope of creating an experience that is unique to two-dimensional space. The intaglio mono-prints are a result of Craig Taylor’s third collaboration with Jennifer Melby Editions, Brooklyn, NY. Craig Taylor received his BFA from Maine College of Art and his MFA from Yale University. In addition to his previous CB1 Gallery exhibition, he has had solo shows at Sue Scott Gallery and March Gallery in New York, La Montagne in Boston, and Test: Showroom, Berlin. Taylor has been included in numerous group exhibitions at various galleries among them CTRL Gallery, Houston, Texas; 106 Greene, Brooklyn, New York; Bakalar and Paine Galleries, Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, and Fred [London], Leipzig. Taylor is an Assistant Professor of painting at the Rhode Island School of Design and has previously taught at Massachusetts College of Art, Pratt, Brandeis University, and Yale University.

The exhibition \"Night Skies\" continues the artist’s explorations with graphite on Bristol while expanding density of detail, complexity of pattern structures, and commitment to challenging content. Before the Flood, Noah retrieved Adam’s body, the body of the first Man, and stowed it on the Ark. After the Flood, Noah’s son Shem saw the sign that God had foretold Noah and followed it to the center of Creation. There Shem buried the Body of Adam and established Jerusalem. Origin myths such as this have the power to transform a landscape by imbuing it with the awe and wonder of fantastical stories. These myths enshrine and transmit important cultural beliefs but the transformation of a place through story can also unfold within the idiosyncrasies of curiosity. Beltz has found this to be true through his fifteen-year interest in roadside ethno botany. The hidden human history connected to a plant, once discovered, can change an anonymous weed into a potent signifier sending the imagination across oceans. At the center of the Artist’s Creation is the tree stump. Without a canopy, the landscape fills with weeds; in this case, the Holy Flower of the North Star, Datura. It is poison, medicine, hallucinogen, bio-remediator, and common roadside plant. This field of weeds is where the Body of Adam will be buried again. Anchored only by his toes, frozen in transcendence, hovering over this low shrub, Adam’s body fades into the flora and becomes the starry night in a glowing explosion. Form dissolves into pattern into a constellated heaven. The unfixed, ponderous Picture Frame then wanders up through the branches of shadowy trees and drifts away, following shifting aspects of the moon and stars, looking for Land. For the past decade Eric Beltz has devoted himself to a simple and focused choice: graphite on Bristol. His drawings are intensely detailed with form, text, pattern, and a stunningly rich grayscale that transcends the limits of the media. Working as a visual essayist and poet, Beltz explores and combines a range of topics: origin myths, American history, ethno botany, ancient religions, and taboo symbolism. He balances the narrow path of pencil on paper with a broad channel cut by his far-reaching interests, seeking discoveries in uncommon mixtures of rare knowledge. Eric Beltz has been in many solo and group shows across the U.S. His work has been featured in Juxtapoz, Art In America, LA Times, NY Times, and American Artist among others. His work is in the permanent collections of the Nerman Museum (KS), Progressive Collection (OH), Santa Barbara Museum of Art (CA), Art, Design, and Architecture Museum (CA), and as a promised gift to the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY).

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"July 7","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

There's nothing like cinematic self-therapy to sooth the cynical soul, and UCLA has a double dose of 1960s political thrillers that should do the trick. The Best Man, featuring a bracingly intelligent screenplay by Gore Vidal based on his TV play, dramatizes the plight of two presidential contenders (Henry Fonda and Cliff Robertson) as they each seek the endorsement of a dying ex-president (Lee Tracy). In Seven Days in May, Kirk Douglas plays a high-ranking aide who suspects his superior, an ambitious general (Burt Lancaster), of plotting a military takeover of the government. The emphasis on surveillance and nuclear disarmament remains eerily relevant, and Rod Serling's righteous screenplay crackles with some of the best lines of the decade.","locationName":"Billy Wilder Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/the-best-man-and-seven-days-in-may-8375393","date":"July 8","type":"Theater","filterType":"Theater","address":"10899 Wilshire Blvd. Westwood, CA 90024 310-206-8013","price":"$10","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/billy-wilder-theater-4195473"},{"name":"Okja","summary":"By Nate Bell Bong Joon-ho is one of the few working directors who truly deserves the overused buzzword “visionary.” His sixth feature film (and second in English, after 2013’s Snowpiercer), Okja, revolves around the efforts of an intrepid young girl to liberate a genetically engineered “super-pig” from the clutches of an evil CEO (Tilda Swinton).

They were two of the original writers hired at Saturday Night Live, where Franken spent 15 years and created the memorable character of Stuart Smalley, the effeminate, self-help guru, who coined the affirmation: \"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough and, doggone it, people like me.\" Franken also recounts his post-SNL career, which includes several books on politics, hosting on the now-defunct Air America radio network and running for senator of Minnesota.

It’s best not to underestimate Kiran Gandhi. The L.A. singer has an MBA from Harvard, is a former drummer for M.I.A. and has steadfastly championed the rights of women, in both her music and her life, including being famously unrepentant two years ago after visibly menstruating during the London Marathon.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"July 8","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Lindner Collection of Antique Printing Machinery, considered by authorities to be one of the largest, most comprehensive collections of historic graphic arts equipment in the world. Linder regularly rented his antique printing equipment to the movie studios, so there's a chance you've seen some of these presses before, playing a role in Newsies, Bonanza, The Twilight Zone, The Last Samurai, Catch Me If You Can or Seven Pounds, to name a few. Visit the museum and you can get their autograph — really. Museum volunteers run the presses for you, explaining how they work, and, if you're lucky, you might take home a souvenir broadsheet. It's a more personalized experience than most museums around town, and educational too — you'll leave understanding why we designate letters \"uppercase\" and \"lowercase,\" and whence came the oft-bandied about entertainment industry term \"slugline.\" (Only open to the public on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., other times are by appointment)","locationName":"International Printing Museum","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/international-printing-museum-4290963","date":"July 8","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"315 W.

The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County's halls of herpetology, ichthyology and mineralogy are open once a month to broke Angelenos dying to keep tabs on the world's ancient life. The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"July 8","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it. The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of philanthropist and children's activist Nancy Daly, which makes perfect sense given the fact that many creative discoveries come from children playing with rocks.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"July 8","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire. The work interrupts the veneer of the hotel lobby, a self-consciously modern space with plush blue banquettes and marble countertops.","locationName":"The Line Hotel","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/henry-taylor-at-the-line-hotel-5847354","date":"July 8","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"3515 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90010 213-381-7411","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/the-line-hotel-4869017"},{"name":"Mission IMPROVable","summary":"The Westside Theater's flagship short-form improv show","locationName":"M.i.

Watts mixes his comedic, instrumental, beatboxing and vocal skills to soulful and sometimes hilarious effect, weaving improvised songs with seemingly as little effort as a skilled guitar player rips a solo or a more conventional stand-up comedian riffs on current events. Those mostly familiar with him as James Corden’s bandleader and sidekick on The Late Late Show have seen only hints of what he’s capable of; fans of his stint on IFC’s Comedy Bang!

Lead singer Shirley Manson transcended that night’s technical difficulties with her usual sharp wit as she imbued a set of Garbage’s early anthems with her own brand of oxymoronic grunge glamour.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"July 9","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Katherine Bernhardt: Fruit Salad","summary":"By Catherine Wagley The exterior of Venus Over Los Angeles, the new West Coast satellite of Venus Over Manhattan gallery, was painted all Pepto-Bismol pink before last week.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"July 9","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Becoming Los Angeles","summary":"By Rena Kosnett No matter how thin your wallet, every first Tuesday (except in July and August), the 50,000-year-old Simi Valley mastodon can be your date.

And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C.

Also on the mainstage: Theatricum’s signature production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (opening June 4); Sir Peter Hall’s adaption of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, with music by Richard Peaslee and lyrics by Adrian Mitchell (opening June 17); Other Desert Cities, the Pulitzer Prize finalist by Jon Robin Baitz about unruly family politics (opening July 8); and Trouble in Mind by pioneering African American playwright, author and actress Alice Childress (opening July 29). Unlike most theaters in the L.A. area that stage continuous runs of a single play, Theatricum will perform each of the plays in repertory through October 1 using a single company of actors — making it possible to see all five plays in a single summer weekend. Patrons are welcome to arrive early and picnic before a performance. Other summer programming at Theatricum includes new play readings from Botanicum Seedlings; comedy improv from Off the Grid; family programming such as Creative PlayGround, Peter Alsop’s Kids Koncerts and a family Barn Dance on the 4th of July; and much more.

Multi-award winner Cameron Watson directs. A very modern kid, with no vowels in his/her name, rents a bedroom in the home of a small-town older Texas couple, while attending a big desert music festival weekend. The couple is struggling with grief and how to find a safe place in the big scary rapidly changing world. The kid decides to help. Like a fairy tale come true the couple suddenly find themselves in a 1970s-era TV game show where the stakes are life itself and the prize is a new beginning, during this thrill ride of a comedy. \"I was surprised at every turn of the page. I’ve always been deeply interested in what tragedy does to the flow of life and how those of us left in the wake of debilitating events deal, or don't deal, with what is left. Because what is left is life as we now know it --- after the explosion, the earthquake, or a fall into the abyss. I think Deb’s play tackles this main conceit from many angles and, in doing so, tackles how we see each other, what we mean to each other, and how we move on. She has draped it with side-splitting humor and fearless imagination.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"July 10","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle. Especially given the formal-looking grayness of the gallery’s New York headquarters, the mural feels like a comic embodiment of an East Coast stereotype: L.A. as la-la land.","locationName":"Venus Over Los Angeles","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/katherine-bernhardt-fruit-salad-5874601","date":"July 10","type":"Art Galleries Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"601 S.

It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"July 10","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"399 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14.

Sure, he’s received plenty of accolades for his work, especially for his recently released 4 Your Eyez Only, but he remains as underrated as it’s possible to be for someone who’s had four consecutive No. 1 albums. On this album — his first with Interscope — Cole tells the story of a man who goes from selling crack to turning his life around, with a twist on the final track. The rapper/multi-instrumentalist continues to deliver a dazzling stage show and evolve creatively in a manner that will both please his current fans and convert new ones in the years to come.

Cranston says, “I was influenced by Van Gogh who frequently would paint the same composition twice in what seemed to be different colors. The hues (the colors of paint) were actually the same only mixed at different ratios. Of course, Monet did the same to achieve different light effects. I have done several works over the years using similar ideas. I am interested in how things look or seem different but be structurally identical.” The new paintings fuse, in Cranston’s idiosyncratic way, her ongoing interest in color theory and how it functions within consumer culture vis-a-vis corporate marketing and branding strategies, as well as its relationship to personal and collective experience, with the aesthetics and history of high Modernist abstraction. Using a palette of the same four colors, Cranston reworks an abstract painting by one of the key figures in Modernism, Swiss / French artist, architect and designer Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier (1887-1965) in six variations, identical in form and composition but in different color combinations. The colors are related to Pantone’s “Color of the Year” designated each year by the New Jersey-based color systems and technology company, found in all manner of consumer products from home décor to fashion, which Cranston has investigated in various ways in several prior exhibitions. Each painting has a shorthand title of a year, for instance, “‘93”, denoting the artist’s personal, intuitive vision of the characteristic colors of that year in history, precise or not. A small acrylic on paper study for the six works, three of which are included in the show, acts as a key to the paintings, each year in the painting’s title significant to the artist in some meaningful way. The lyrical abstraction of these paintings is contrasted with smaller geometric abstract paintings, rigid in structure and form, but handmade, with deliberately imperfect and variably weighted lines, in an ironic and humorous way.","locationName":"Meliksetian | Briggs","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/meg-cranston-same-composition-different-hues-different-titles-8361533","date":"July 11","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"313 N.

The exhibition titled \"Head\" defines the images in terms of seriality, this new collection of works on paper show how the variant image of a head, can be cross pollinated in one medium and eventually fed into another. Craig Taylor continues to investigate motifs in the shape of a head. Built out of layered systems of mark making, the abstract lines are saliently grafted onto the head-like form so as to capture the transformation of pictorial order. The exhibition consists of 6 paintings on paper and 6 intaglio mono-prints. Evident in the work is the fluidity of a back and forth between mediums. At times the images are nearly descriptive in terms of illusionism but they quickly traverse back to flatness. Lines, globules, dashes, and streaks occupy the figure as if it’s defaced with a mischievous eccentric writing. Pulsating lines operate like a congealed EEG test across the entirety of the form. As a process, the marks fill up the space while they also describe the space they are filling. In the paintings on paper, the space can have an immediacy that is monumentally intimate. Discordant colors embody the \"HEAD (variant)\"–country club green, bright red, deep luminous yellow, and peacock blue, sit in relation to shades of muted green. The marks are fluid and blobby but the \"HEAD (variant)\" creates an original within the possible fixed matrix. Color and line converge to create the inside and outside at the same time. The form can be at once your existential-self or maybe something as uncanny as a monstrous topiary blooming before the eyes. This work is in a constant battle between verb and noun. Predicated on the hope of creating an experience that is unique to two-dimensional space.

The exhibition \"Night Skies\" continues the artist’s explorations with graphite on Bristol while expanding density of detail, complexity of pattern structures, and commitment to challenging content. Before the Flood, Noah retrieved Adam’s body, the body of the first Man, and stowed it on the Ark. After the Flood, Noah’s son Shem saw the sign that God had foretold Noah and followed it to the center of Creation. There Shem buried the Body of Adam and established Jerusalem. Origin myths such as this have the power to transform a landscape by imbuing it with the awe and wonder of fantastical stories. These myths enshrine and transmit important cultural beliefs but the transformation of a place through story can also unfold within the idiosyncrasies of curiosity. Beltz has found this to be true through his fifteen-year interest in roadside ethno botany. The hidden human history connected to a plant, once discovered, can change an anonymous weed into a potent signifier sending the imagination across oceans. At the center of the Artist’s Creation is the tree stump. Without a canopy, the landscape fills with weeds; in this case, the Holy Flower of the North Star, Datura. It is poison, medicine, hallucinogen, bio-remediator, and common roadside plant. This field of weeds is where the Body of Adam will be buried again. Anchored only by his toes, frozen in transcendence, hovering over this low shrub, Adam’s body fades into the flora and becomes the starry night in a glowing explosion. Form dissolves into pattern into a constellated heaven. The unfixed, ponderous Picture Frame then wanders up through the branches of shadowy trees and drifts away, following shifting aspects of the moon and stars, looking for Land. For the past decade Eric Beltz has devoted himself to a simple and focused choice: graphite on Bristol. His drawings are intensely detailed with form, text, pattern, and a stunningly rich grayscale that transcends the limits of the media. Working as a visual essayist and poet, Beltz explores and combines a range of topics: origin myths, American history, ethno botany, ancient religions, and taboo symbolism. He balances the narrow path of pencil on paper with a broad channel cut by his far-reaching interests, seeking discoveries in uncommon mixtures of rare knowledge. Eric Beltz has been in many solo and group shows across the U.S. His work has been featured in Juxtapoz, Art In America, LA Times, NY Times, and American Artist among others. His work is in the permanent collections of the Nerman Museum (KS), Progressive Collection (OH), Santa Barbara Museum of Art (CA), Art, Design, and Architecture Museum (CA), and as a promised gift to the Whitney Museum of American Art (NY). Eric Beltz lives and works in Santa Barbara, CA where he teaches drawing at UCSB.","locationName":"CB1 Gallery","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/eric-beltz-night-skies-8272259","date":"July 11","type":"Art Galleries Arts & Culture","filterType":"Art","address":"1923 S.

Olson’s photographs are printed, repeated, and collaged to encase each ceramic piece. His motifs vary in scale creating a rhythm as they wrap around and across each artwork. When fired, the prints burn away leaving permanent, rusty red colored images from the iron oxide in the ink. His delicately patterned pieces embody fluctuating visual narratives, as kaleidoscopes that span centuries and continents. Peter Olson’s subjects retain a connection to Western art history and religion, but hone in on his passion; street photography. These vignettes capture the city streets most familiar to the artist, with its harried workers and “angry strangers” as he calls them. The artist delights in the challenge of these increasingly complex surfaces and nuanced patterning of images. Classical art historical references abound, in the artist’s enthusiasm for museums and iconography, spliced with modern people in full motion. How will historians of future generations view these pots and iconography against the Greeks? Like the shards of ancient vessels and tiles we study in search of knowledge lost, these contemporary fired ceramics fused with iron oxide do not decompose. In this work we can imagine our own images represented, wholly or in shards, at a future site; and wonder how we will be remembered. Based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Olson has travelled the world collecting his visual experiences through photography. Olson has spent over 35 years as an accomplished photographer. He earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in photography and film at the University of the Arts, Philadelphia, PA. He learned how to throw on the wheel at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia 5 years ago and has been working with clay ever since. Approximately forty ceramic works and photographs will be exhibited. A catalog with a forward by Garth Clark and an essay by Jo Lauria will be available.","locationName":"American Museum of Ceramic Art","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/peter-olson-photo-ceramica-7950099","date":"July 11","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"399 N.

This show celebrates the resilience in life. It explores the limits of the human condition. Life is broken, glass fragmented pieces; the light shines through our sharp edges and hard times creating something truly stunning. In brokenness, in pain is light and beauty.

Kids who watched it wound up being better at explaining science than those who didn't. After appearing on air for five seasons and winning a bunch of Emmys, Nye sits down with chapeaued journalist Patt Morrison for the Los Angeles Times Ideas Exchange With Bill Nye to discuss his new book, Everything All at Once: How to Unleash Your Inner Nerd, Tap Into Radical Curiosity and Solve Any Problem.

Now the side of the building is a sunny mural by New York artist Katherine Bernhardt called Fruit Salad — toucans, fat bananas and flattened cigarettes float across the wall. There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

She was retracing routes her own relatives took at the end of the 1930s, after the Spanish Civil War, when they, like so many other defeated Republicans, trekked off. Along the way, Fernandez collected souvenirs, documents and photographs that she then recreated as paintings, drawings or objects. She also invented artifacts based on her own memory or sensory experiences. Walking through her show at Commonwealth and Council is like opening up a grandmother’s trunk and finding that everything in it, even documents related to the harshest memories, has been tenderly, painstakingly handmade then carefully arranged.","locationName":"Commonwealth & Council","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/patricia-fernandezs-point-of-departure-five-walks-5562978","date":"July 12","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"3006 W.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.

It includes Oakland’s G-Funk queen Kamaiyah, major-label cloud rapper Playboi Carti, kooky underground personality Ugly God, viral hitmaker Aminé and outlaw sensation XXXTentacion. How all of these different personalities and styles will mesh together in one show is anybody’s guess, especially considering the violence following XXXTentacion’s current tour around the country, but it’ll certainly be interesting.
