[{"name":"Eastside Mural Ride","summary":"By Gwynedd Stuart L.A.'s Latino heritage is richly represented in murals on walls throughout the city, but particularly in East L.A. and other neighborhoods east of downtown. (No, Silver Lake isn't the Eastside, dudes.) To celebrate that tradition and to encourage transportation policy that encourages bike- and pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods, Multicultural Communities for Mobility and L.A. Metro are hosting the Eastside Mural Ride, a roughly 10-mile bike ride through East L.A. and City Terrace. Besides mural appreciation, riders will learn about bike safety and riding in traffic with insufficient bike infrastructure, and bike mechanics will be on hand in case of any blowouts or other mishaps. There's no better way to see the city.","locationName":"East L.A.

Alvarez’s tragicomic riff on Russian melancholy, is that it is not Chekhov by another name. True, Alvarez’s going-to-seed, middle-aged app designer Nicky (Cyrus Wilcox) does sport the diminutive and even much of the demeanor of Nikolai Ivanov, the brooding, Hamlet-like hero of Chekhov’s first full-length drama, Ivanov. And Alvarez’s story boasts generically similar situations and even lifts much of the dramatis personae from the father of Russian drama. Nevertheless, as the disclaimer goes, any resemblance to what is usually meant by the word “Chekhovian” in Coeurage Theatre Company’s world-premiere offering at Greenway Court Theatre is entirely coincidental. That’s because rather than an adaptation, which might be expected to blow the dust off a canonical classic for a modern audience, Alvarez has simply lifted the familiar shell of Ivanov and dropped it onto the very different chassis of what plays as a 1980s closet melodrama. Act 1 opens on Benoît Guérin’s midcentury-modern living room set as Nicky sunbathes at his Palm Springs swimming pool. It turns out that the pool is as far as he can get from his devoted Filipina wife Anna (Sandy Velasco) without actually physically leaving the house. Even the sound of her warbling the treacly Debby Boone ballad, \"You Light Up My Life,\" on her home karaoke machine elicits his physical revulsion. At first Nicky’s avoidance seems to be denial over what is soon revealed as Anna’s advanced cancer. Or maybe he is merely depressed over his imminent bankruptcy and hiding from his main creditor, Zina (Emily Swallow), the miserly, loan shark wife of his best friend Pavel (Daniel Kaemon). It is only when Nicky attends the 21st birthday party for Sasha (Chris Aguila), Pavel and Zina’s gay son, that the secret torch Nicky and Sasha have been hiding finally flares into view. The consequences of that public revelation play out in Act 2 as Anna’s crushing disillusionment, Pavel’s sense of angry betrayal and Nicky’s emotional seesawing between acceptance, guilt and self-loathing. The accepted view of Chekhov is that by successfully blending the tragic and the comic and by locating emotion between the lines rather than on top of them, he gave the world the modern drama of psychological discovery. But in Beth Lopes’ sometimes unfocussed staging (strained by a surfeit of interstitial furniture moving), emotions are pinned onto the ensemble’s sleeves and the laughs feel little more than nervous comic relief. Jaime Barcelon, Taylor Hawthorne and Mark Jacobson make a welcome appearance as a trio of Sasha’s wisecracking gay demimonde friends, and the always intense Jeremy Lelliott injects antic energy as the tippler Misha, but too much of the vestigial Chekhovian bric-a-brac only gets in the way. The play’s depiction of Nicky and his circle (Ted Barton, Alexis Genya, Julia Silverman) as some sort of Russian high-tech diaspora in the California desert particularly seems like a stretch. Still, Nicky has enough hints at the more personally compelling story that one suspects Alvarez wanted to tell — Michelle Stann’s suggestively camp sound design; Velasco’s poignant portrait of immigrant longing — that one wishes he’d have merely jettisoned Anton and made it an all-Boni show.","locationName":"Greenway Court Theatre","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/nicky-8311621","date":"July 1","type":"Theater","filterType":"Theater","address":"544 N.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible.

Swedish occult rockers Ghost will add to the metal celebration with the catchy Satanic sing-alongs, such as “Square Hammer,” that have made them a fan favorite in recent years.","locationName":"Glen Helen Amphitheater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/iron-maiden-8357451","date":"July 1","type":"Metal Rock","filterType":"Music","address":"2575 Glen Helen Parkway San Bernardino, CA 92407 909-880-6500","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/glen-helen-amphitheater-5508639"},{"name":"Agent Orange, JFA, Harbortown Saints","summary":"By Sam Ribakoff Despite the encroaching luxury condos, Long Beach is still very much a working-class city, musically defined as much by the G-Funk hip-hop of the ’90s as by the hardcore, skate punk and ska scenes that have been an off-and-on presence in the city since the early ’80s. That makes the slightly seedy Alex’s Bar in Long Beach a perfect venue, in a perfect city, to see the ’80s surf-punk pioneers Agent Orange and the skate-punk trailblazers JFA. Although both bands are getting up there in age, they still play with an impassioned snarl that can match any 18-year-old punk’s energy. Both bands should bring in a typically diverse mix of Long Beach punks of all races and orientations.","locationName":"Alex's Bar","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/agent-orange-jfa-harbortown-saints-8304289","date":"July 1","type":"Punk Rock Surf","filterType":"Music","address":"2913 E.

Dwan showed the original version of it in her Los Angeles gallery in 1966, and LACMA’s show highlights the impressive scope and ambition of Dwan’s program. She helped artist Michael Heizer dig two huge gashes in the Mojave Desert and helped Charles Ross build his templelike star chamber in New Mexico. Later, after she opened her New York space, she showed the conceptual, wry and strange work of Lee Lozano. (There was a dearth of female artists in Dwan’s repertoire, however, as there have been in so many programs run by women as well as men.) Dwan cared about her artists and their work deeply and rarely broadcast her own influence. Few know that her patronage made the United States’ most iconic land artworks possible. She never liked talking much about art, as she explained during a talk she gave at LACMA on March 14. She was interested instead in the gestalt, the whole immersive experience of the artworks she loved.","locationName":"LACMA","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/dwan-gallery-exhibition-image-los-angeles-to-new-york-dwan-gallery-1959-1971-8060469","date":"July 2","type":"Art Museums","filterType":"Art","address":"5905 Wilshire Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90036 323-857-6000","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/lacma-2184168"},{"name":"Hassan Hajjaj: My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I","summary":"By Catherine Wagley Linda Komaroff, head of LACMA's Art of the Middle East department, recently acquired Moroccan artist Hassan Hajjaj's My Rock Stars Experimental, Volume I for the museum. It includes footage of nine musicians known by the artist, some more famous than others, playing against patterned fabric and wearing fantastic, comfortable-looking costumes Hajjaj made for them. Hajjaj filmed each separately but you see all of them at once, each inhabiting his or her own colorful rectangle and taking turns making music. The multichannel video currently plays in a narrow corridor on the third floor of LACMA's Ahmanson building, by the elevators. It's awkward to see it in that space but interesting, too, because it seems indicative of the still-marginal place contemporary Middle Eastern art holds in most U.S. museum collections. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., Mid-Wilshire; ongoing.

But he quit his job there at the end of the 1960s, and soon after opened an odd store known as The Black Hole. The store’s inventory would all be cast-offs from the Lab--technical equipment, paperwork or office furniture. Some of it would be quite value, other items obscure. After Grothus died in 2009, the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) visited the still-open store and found two rolodexes, full of business cards members of the corporate community had handed to the bomb-making lab. Right now, at CLUI’s small Culver City space, cards line the walls. Marketing coordinators, engineers and sales reps from the Kodak Company half-smile in headshots. There’s a sense of outdated aspiration throughout the exhibition -- all these cards belonging to people who hoped to get in on the big business of nuclear war. “Ultimately, the bomb was made by people calling other people on the phone,” writes CLUI director Matthew Coolidge in his essay on the rolodexes.","locationName":"Center for Land Use Interpretation","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/los-alamos-rolodex-doing-business-with-the-national-lab-1967-1978-6468286","date":"July 2","type":"Art Galleries","filterType":"Art","address":"9331 Venice Blvd. Culver City, CA 90232 310-839-5722","price":"Free","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/center-for-land-use-interpretation-2193876"},{"name":"Tree of Testimony: L.A.

Thick black tubes squiggle on the wall behind the TVs, and keywords like \"ghetto cultural activities,\" \"sisters\" and \"wartime photographs\" pop up on the screens to help you decide whose private miseries to experience, meaning which testimony's code to enter into your free iPod Touch audio guide. Conceived by museum board president Randy Schoenberg and executed by architect Hagey Belzberg, the Tree of Testimony represents the first attempt to display the 52,000 Shoah Foundation testimonies outside of stand-alone screens.

The Dinosaur Hall and \"Becoming L.A.\" are new and exciting exhibits -- the latter a 14,000-square-foot display of the story of Los Angeles in six parts: the time of Spanish contact; the Spanish Mission era; the Mexican rancho era; the early American period; the emergence of a new American city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; and the Great Depression and World War II to the present. You must admit, the tagline for this new exhibit, \"Cow Poop Changed L.A.,\" is quite an attention grabber.

There’s also an out-of-place interlude in which hammerhead sharks swim around inside a blue rectangle.

With Ron Lynch","summary":"By Sophia Kercher Scan the seats at the Steve Allen Theater on Saturday at midnight and you'll find them half-empty. The audience members are half-stoned, half-drunk or high on the fact that they're breaking curfew. They are old and young, but mostly bearded and beer-bellied. And they keep coming back, some from as far away as San Diego, for the nutty midnight variety show. You will find such things as wacky video installations, a juggler tossing cigar boxes, Michael Jackson–inspired dance routines, ukulele concerts, one-man-band sets and whiskey-soaked stand-up comedy. Host Ron Lynch, who has been in the comedy scene for 30-plus years, leads The Tomorrow Show with his sardonic observations. As night crawls to morning, Lynch's head of hair grows bigger and bigger. Somewhere within his crop of curls he keeps six years of memories including shows that have lasted until 4 a.m., epic nights featuring co-hosts Craig Anton, John C. Reilly or The Kids in the Hall's Scott Thompson. The Tomorrow Show is guaranteed to be one of your weirdest encounters with the L.A. entertainment scene. It's raw and experimental. But the inventive weekly acts are a welcome reminder that you can always start anew tomorrow — and that's worth a late night in Hollywood.","locationName":"Trepany House at the Steve Allen Theater","detailPage":"http://www.laweekly.com/event/tomorrow-with-ron-lynch-4290611","date":"July 2","type":"Comedy","filterType":"Comedy","address":"4773 Hollywood Blvd. Los Angeles, CA 90027 323-666-4268","price":"","locationLink":"http://www.laweekly.com/location/trepany-house-at-the-steve-allen-theater-2186233"},{"name":"Levitated Mass","summary":"By David Cotner Just when you thought you'd figured out what art really is, Levitated Mass by Michael Heizer is where modern art and the Protestant work ethic weirdly intersect, which is to say that a 340-ton granite megalith painstakingly transported over two weeks from Riverside sits in a 456-foot-long slot, and you get to contemplate it all. Clearly, your kid couldn't do that. Forty-five years in the making -- from concept to construction to carefully avoided clusterfuck -- it's whatever you want it to be. Process art? Yes. Land art? Yes. Cubism? Well, yes, depending on where you're standing when you look at it.

It's just going to happen.\" He may have started saying that before he began using milk cartons in his work, painting them black and affixing them to poles or panels. The cartons themselves, sometimes cut up or open, are somewhat grimy. The black paint makes them look like litter caught in an oil spill. So it's gratifying to see one of Taylor's black milk carton sculptures hanging behind the reception desk at the Line Hotel on Wilshire.
