His songs have been recorded by our finest voices including Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, Linda Ronstadt, Glen Campbell, and Art Garfunkel. Webb is the only artist to have received GRAMMY Awards for music, lyrics and orchestration and was the youngest man ever inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In his new book, The Cake and The Rain: A Memoir, Webb delivers a snapshot of his life from 1955 to 1970, from simple farm in Oklahoma to fast and fantastical Los Angeles, from the crucible of his family to the top of his longed-for profession. The Cake and The Rain is a surprising and unusual book: Webb's talent as a writer and storyteller is here on every page. His book is rich with a sense of time and place, and with the voices of characters, vanished and living, famous and not, but all intimately involved with him in his youth, when life seemed nothing more than a party and Webb the eternal guest of honor. Webb's first book, Tunesmith: The Art of Songwriting is considered a bible among musicians. The GRAMMY Museum welcomes Jimmy Webb for a discussion on his extraordinary career and new memoir The Cake and The Rain. The evening will be hosted by GRAMMY Foundation Vice President Scott Goldman and will be followed by an intimate performance. A book signing will be held after the program.","location":"","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/evening-jimmy-webb","date":"April 26","type":" / Music      "},{"name":"Absinthe","summary":"Ticket Information:","location":"L.A.

Decades later, Landau rediscovered his Kodachromes , which ended up being the most extensive collection of photographs to document this remarkable Sunset Strip phenomenon. Inspired, he interviewed the artists, record producers, and designers who brought the billboards to life, lending fresh insight to the culture of the day.  It’s all chronicled in Landau’s book Rock ‘N’ Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip (Angel City Press). In conjunction with a public art exhibit consisting of 10 large format versions of Robert Landau's photos; this talk is presented by the City of West Hollywood through Weho Arts and WeHo Reads (www.weho.org/arts) as part of  'There's Something Happening Here...' a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the counterculture era on the Sunset Strip.
