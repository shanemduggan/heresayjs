Bobcat’s off-the-beaten-path style of creating movies allows audiences to experience films that other artists may have never dared to attempt.

Armenians who survived the Armenian Genocide began migrating to the area as refugees. Each quarter was populated by natives from a village in their original homeland which re-gifted its name to the new quarter such as Marash, Nor-Adana, and Nor-Sis. Erecting schools, churches, cultural centers and maintaining political affiliations with concerted national codes, it was here where national identity was resurrected as a means to hold on to what was violently ended in the homeland. Between 1975 and 1995, the district witnessed drastic population shifts as a result of the Lebanese civil war. Most Armenian inhabitants of the quarter fled the country and others moved out of the area to better their social ranking. Bourj Hammoud is the last bastion of Armenian collective memory as it is a direct consequence of a crime against humanity perpetrated over a hundred years ago against the Armenian people.","location":"Roslin Art Gallery","eventDetail":"http://www.discoverlosangeles.com/what-to-do/events/birds-nest-opening-photography-exhibit-about-bourj-hammoud","address":"415 E.
